{"text": "UCSD is ‘silencing voices they don’t want to hear,’Koala editor says The University of California-San Diego has made plain where its values lie: in favor of a failing Marxist-inspired cafe and against an “offensive and hurtful” student tabloid. Just hours after high-ranking UCSD officials released a statement condemning The Koala, a student-funded publication with a penchant for profanity and pornography, the student government voted to defund all student-funded media. The editor of The Koala told The College Fix the school was betraying its own values as a “world-class university” and that he was pursuing “legal means” to overturn the defunding vote. In a statement signed by Chancellor Pradeep Khosla and other vice chancellors, the administration wrote Nov. 18 that The Koala is “profoundly repugnant, repulsive, attacking and cruel.” Noting the administration doesn’t fund The Koala, the statement called on the UCSD community to “join us in condemning this publication and other hurtful acts.” The administration didn’t respond to a Fix inquiry about the timing of its statement. The last print run of The Koala, which referred to the chancellor as “Ballsdeep Pradeep,” was more than two weeks ago, though it published a blog post Nov. 16 that mocked safe spaces and used the N-word repeatedly. Watch out for us on library walk next week for the new issue of The Motherfucking Koala! Posted by The Koala on Friday, November 6, 2015 One of the signatories, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Juan Gonzalez, read the statement at the start of the student government meeting the same night, The Guardian campus newspaper reported. The constitutional amendment to remove student-fee funding from all student publications was submitted by Daniel Juarez, assistant vice president of equity, diversity and inclusion. It passed 22-3-0. Those affected include another satirical publication, The Muir Quarterly, as well as The Progressive and the Saltman Quarterly, a science newsletter, though the latter two did not receive any funding this term. The Guardian is not affected because it doesn’t take student funding. Muir’s editor-in-chief, Andrew Deneris, told The Guardian that the student publications were blindsided by the sudden defunding. He said the answer to offensive speech was not “less speech and less media.” When contacted about this trend following this Sunday’s mass, the Pope responded he thought it was “pretty rad.” Posted by The MQ on Sunday, November 1, 2015 The student government will divert the approximately $15,0 per year that went toward campus publications toward projects such as housing, The Guardian said. Funding is not ‘the real issue here’ The Koala’s tagline, “The Worst in Collegiate Journalism Since 1982,” gives readers an idea of what to expect, as does its budget request for this term: $696,969.69. One recent post on its website, which meets any definition of “not safe for work,” is titled “ UCSD Unveils New Dangerous Space on Campus.” After the administration statement, The Koala published a crude imagined email chain among Khosla and vice chancellors. Its latest issue is even more graphic and includes an invented list of “Executed Oregon Students” on the editorial masthead. Gabe Cohen, The Koala’s editor-in-chief, told The Fix in an email that “funding is not our main concern, and isn’t the real issue here.” Indeed, The Koala said on its Facebook page Friday that it raised $1,0 in less than 24 hours following the defunding vote. It had been allotted just $634 by the student government for this term. UCSD is “silencing voices they don’t want to hear,” Cohen told The Fix, blaming “political correctness” on campus: “It stifles valuable voices in fear of harming the feelings of students. Students should not be ‘kept safe’ from hurt feelings.” He continued: “Discussion is always constructive, censorship never is.” The Koala has reached out to the other defunded publications with the goal of putting up a united front, Cohen said. It has “been in touch” with the ACLU and Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, “and have sought other legal means,” he said. “We plan on exhausting each and every option at our disposal to inform the university their decision is wrong, and probably illegal.” ‘Student funds should not support a cause that makes community members feel unsafe’ The head of student government said the defunding vote was not about content, but funding priorities. The student government “decided to discontinue print media funding as it was determined that there were other areas of campus that could better benefit from the limited resources of the Associated Students,” President Dominick Suvonnasupa told The Fix in an email. “All campus media organizations have received suggestions of on [sic] alternative funding sources,” he said. According to The Guardian’s narrative of the student government meeting, Charlotte Lu, a sophomore at USCD’s Thurgood Marshall College, urged the “Council to defund the [Koala] on the grounds that student funds should not support a cause that makes community members feel unsafe.” “I am a goddess–a glorious female warrior, queen of all that I survey. Enemies of fairness and equality, hear my womanly roar! Yeeeeeah!” Posted by Charlotte Lu on Sunday, September 6, 2015 This is not the first time UCSD’s student government has attempted to defund The Koala. In early 2010, after working with then-Chancellor Marye Anne Fox and the Black Student Union, the student government froze funding for all student-funded publications, including The Koala, The Guardian reported then. According to the student body president at the time, Utsav Gupta: “I think it’s obvious why we froze the funds. There were a lot of students who were angry” at The Koala. One official called it hate speech. While the student government ponders the best use of the now-available $15,0, the UCSD administration had pledged $700,0 to bail out the student-run Che Cafe Collective, as The Fix reported last week.

{"text": "YORK, Pa. – If Donald Trump doesn’t carry Pennsylvania, his chances of becoming president reach the vanishing point. For now, he’s in deep trouble in a place that, demographically, ought to be a Trumpian promised land. A poll released Tuesday, by NBC News, the Wall Street Journal and Marist, found Hillary Clinton leading by 11 points in Pennsylvania in a two-way race with Trump, and by nine when Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein are added to the mix. Key to Clinton’s leads in all the recent surveys: the aversion of women to Donald Trump. It’s not hard to run into such voters, even among Republicans in York County, a GOP redoubt that gave Mitt Romney 60 percent of its votes in 2012 and John McCain 56 percent four years earlier, even as both were losing statewide. Susan Byrnes, a York County Commissioner and a moderate Republican who supported John Kasich in the Pennsylvania primary, said her work with veterans over the years explains her horror over Trump’s comments about the Khan family and his casual treatment of the matter of earning a Purple Heart. “The way he interacted with the parents of a Muslim soldier and the way he talked about the Purple Heart – it almost made my heart stop,” she said in a telephone interview from a County Commissioners’ gathering in the Poconos. “I can’t vote for someone like that.” Kristen Fraser is a lawyer and businesswoman who wrote in Paul Ryan’s name in the primary and is exactly the sort of voter the Republican Party needs to cherish. She can’t vote for Hillary Clinton, she said, but added: “My social views are very liberal. I can’t bring myself to vote for Trump.” Both Byrnes and Fraser spoke to me before Trump’s “Second Amendment” comments on Tuesday that hinted at violence against Clinton. Fraser was part of a group that gathered to talk about the campaign at The Left Bank, a popular eatery here, brought together for me by Allison Roth-Cooper and Patrick DeLany, top editors of the York Dispatch. In the course of the discussion, Roth-Cooper made a point often lost in a campaign discourse focused on the spectacular and the ideological. “This area is a little bit Southern in its attitude toward manners and decorum,” she said. “Common decency is a core part of who people are.” She doesn’t say so directly, but her point is clear: Trump may simply be too rude and coarse for many who are conservative in their politics but traditional in their view of how leaders should behave. If any recently Democratic state should be hospitable to Trump, Pennsylvania is it with the fifth oldest population in the country (Trump is strongest with older voters) and an electorate in which white voters form a slightly larger share than the national average. The Keystone State has hemorrhaged jobs overseas for decades and has been skeptical of free trade going back to the 1840s. And there has been palpable discontent with Democrats here for some time: Romney cut Obama’s 2008 statewide margin of 620,478 to 309,840 in 2012. No one at the Left Bank gathering doubted that Trump would carry York County, and Carla Christopher, a community organizer who supported Bernie Sanders, said there was continued discontent with Clinton among progressives even as blue-collar voters “are fresh and raw” in their anger over economic changes that have left them worse off than their parents and grandparents. The Clinton campaign is acting as if it does not believe she has the big lead here that public polls suggest. It has pulled its ads from Virginia and Colorado, where she is well ahead, but not from Pennsylvania. State Rep. Stanley Saylor, a Republican legislator for 24 years (he supported Marco Rubio in the primaries) is skeptical of the statewide polls. He believes Trump will run ahead of Romney by winning over blue-collar Democrats and union members “who like the fact that he’s not giving them the same spiel that politicians give to them every time” and “that he’s not politically correct.” When it comes to yard signs, he notes, there are far more for Trump (and Sanders) than for Clinton. Saylor may yet be proved right. But Trump’s problem is with the quiet “manners and decorum” voters who are still making up their minds. What his supporters relish as straight-talking can look reckless and dangerous to those not yet in the fold. Day by day, he’s making it no easier for them to come his way. E.J.

{"text": "It’s no laughing matter. The big news is NBC’s venerable Tonight Show has killed — 20 jobs, that is, and host Jay Leno has reportedly taken a big pay cut to save jobs. Reports suggest this is not about ratings but about NBC’s new owner wanting to trim costs. Deadline Hollywood’s Nikki Finke reports: NBC insiders tell me The Tonight Show went through ”downsizing” today and that 20 staffers lost their jobs. Others tell me the number is more like 25, and producers were forced to take pay cuts or lose their jobs. I’ve also learned that Jay Leno took what is being described as a “tremendous” pay cut to “save as many people’s jobs as he could”. Leno’s Tonight Show is consistently the #1 late night talk show in both households and demographics, except for some anomalies when Leno does get beaten. And that’s despite the fact the network’s primetime ratings have been dismal for many years or that Leno himself was harshly criticized by the media for that January 2010 standoff with Conan O’Brien. Even so there is one reality here: the days are long gone when The Tonight Show is so intensely dominant that it’s name is synonymous with late night comedy. It is an often solid show, but since Johnny Carson retired and David Letterman bolted, the audience has been fragmented. Plus, this is an era of “narrow-casting,” where the are many more entertainment choices — offered on various entertainment platforms. The Tonight Show’s golden age vanished just as CBS News’ golden age of dominance vanished when Walter Cronkite retired and the ill-suited Dan Rather took over the slot — and networks were challenged by cable news. MORE: Even so, The Tonight Show has been and still is a cash cow for NBC. So what happened to merit the downsizing? “I don’t think ad sales are off. I just think the people who bought this company, Comcast, wants to go through everything at NBC and get their money back,” an NBC insider tells me. ”It’s hard to go through those kinds of cuts. It’s more a network issue than a late-night issue. And I would say that Jay doesn’t get credit for digging out of a gigantic hole every single night. He’s a very valuable guy to NBC and someday everyone will understand that. He does a great job.” Even so, the reality is this: the late night shows are still funny, still worth staying up for or recording. But this is a different era in entertainment and their stars have literally waned since the 1990s. And this is the day with the corporate bigwigs are trying to trim costs as they nervously look over the shoulders at an ailing economy and competing forms of entertainment. You can’t say that the late night shows are yet “oh, so 20 century” but they don’t appear to be on track to be “oh so late 21st century, either.” And, yes, if this report is true, Leno — who has endured his share of p.r. snafus over the years (getting the slot over Letterman and being accused he was a better office politician; the O’Brien fiasco) does deserve credit for thinking about the jobs of others.

{"text": "By Scott Crass Anyone willing to bet the House? With Election Day now three months to the day away, Democratic leaders continue to publicly express optimism that they can retake control of the lower chamber. Republicans meanwhile are still exercising confidence but largely echo the cautious view of Speaker John Boehner that,”we’ve got a lot of work to do between now and November, but I’m feeling good.” I don’t know of anyone well-versed in this environment that thinks that Democrats can gain even close to the 25 seats needed to wrest away the big gavel that Boehner selected. But numbers do matter and how well the party can do is quite important for Democratic morale, particularly revving up toward the next election. Democrats initial hopes for major gains were predicated on the large number of freshman members of the 2010 class –87, and the fact that redistricting, which at it’s outset seemed destined to cost the party ten seats alone, ultimately ended very much a wash. But early indications of loopholes that for a time, seemed poised to give the party unlikely successes in states where the GOP controls the trifecta unravelled one by one — at least as far as this cycle is concerned. Additionally, an increasingly neck’n’neck presidential race adds equal uncertainty to contests that may well fall into my “tossup and then some” classification, such as Colorado-3 and Wisconsin-7, where freshman GOP incumbents are trying to stave off determined and very credible challengers. Let’s take redistricting first. How did it play out? Arizona,Colorado,and Nevada were spectacular success stories for the party, and if all the chips fall the right way, could yield as many as seven additional Democrats (see later).In other cases, buoyancy turned to heartache. An unlikely opportunity to get a referendum on Ohio’s districts failed when just enough Democrats in the Legislature joined with Republicans to block it. In Texas, an initial plan by a judicial panel may well have yielded Democrats all four of the new seats the “Lone Star”State’s was gaining, with a plausible opportunity for 1-2 more. But the GOP appealed to the Supreme Court, which remanded the map back to the lower court. Now, Ds will gain 2 seats, but so will the GOP. A 3rd seat, TX-23, is genuinely competitive but Ds did get perhaps their biggest break of the cycle when the candidate they strongly felt was most electable captured the nomination in a runoff. This race is a tossup. Democrats had also hoped that a voter adopted amendment mandating “compactness” of districts would yield them a 5-6 seat gain in Florida. That would be done by breaking up the elongated Tallahasse-Jacksonville based 3rd, and by merging communities from the Sunshine Skyway Bridge that connects Tamap and St.Petersburg. But a Judge decided that a hearing was necessary which would put any changes on hold until 2014. It was not all bad in the “Sunshine State” for Democrats. The two new seats effectively went to Democrats, and several other GOP incumbents were weakened. But it’s no secret that the beneficiaries of those seats ,Alan Grayson and Lois Frankel have controversies within and pickups aren’t certain. Democrats also have an opportunity to wrest away Alan West’s seat. But West will never suffer for money and did win a seat that was even more hostile to the GOP in ’10, albeit a poor year for challengers.Expect a photo finish here. Democrats are also hoping to take advantage of two scandal tarred incumbents,David Rivera and Vern Buchanan. Neither will be easy. The Cuban-American community is very loyal to Rivera, while Buchanan has reserved $4 million in air time for October. But there is widespread perception that Buchanan is letting the crisis define him, and an increasingly competitive Sarasota anchored district could well produce an upset. Then there is California. Voters adopted an Independent Commission to draw their boundaries and the result was, chaos. Incumbents everywhere, even those who had been long immune to challenge. Democrats lost one ley — and likely opportunity but were spared similar outcome in CA-26. That will likely put that seat in their column, which would seem to ensure that at minimum, the party enters the 113th Congress with the same number of seats in the delegation – 34, that they have now. Democrats also have a good opportunity to defeat the increasingly aloof Dan Lungren. In an open Riverside seat, Democrats are high on Mark Takano’s chances But the GOP took 54.6% in the all-party vote and Republicans are hopeful that their centrist, and well-known candidate, John Taviglione, can hold the seat. Still, given that the low primary turnout benefited Republicans and that California is not likely to be hospitable to Romney, winning the seat won’t be easy. Neither will holding CA-52, where Brian Bilbray took a measily 41% in the primary. But a newly created Central Valley seat that once held promise is now certain to fall to the GOP, and Democratic prospects of taking out freshman Jeff Denham are iffy at best. Democrats are not immune to challenges in the “Golden State,”but John Garamendi, Jerry McNerney, and to a lesser extent Lois Capps seem poised to hold off moderately strong GOP challengers. Beyond redistricting, Democrats feel good about low hanging fruit. Joe Walsh has embarrassed even some Republicans with his full-steam Tea-Party backing,and in a CD that gave Obama 61%, Tammy Duckworth is an absolute lock. Ann Marie Buerkle and Chip Cravvack of Minnesota scored the biggest upsets of Dem.incumbents. Neither is going down without a fight but given the Democratic leans of these districts, coupled with the fact that neither Buerkle or Cravvack’s ideology seems a strong fit, they may come through. And 86 year old Roscoe Bartlett, despite having adjusted to the rigors of a modern campaign, appears to be faltering. Republicans point out that Bob Ehrlich carried the district as he was getting swamped statewide, but a Presidential contest will put different dynamics at work. Now let’s look at other GOP incumbents, as that’s where Democrats will have to make gains if they want to come anywhere near a future majority. In Illinois, Democrats drew three GOP incumbents into seats that gave Obama at least 60%, but Judy Biggert, Bob Dold, and Bobby Schilling are in no worse than tossups. And Democrats must contend with a fight for one of their seats in an area that Obama carried, but the Dem. base is shrinking.But Ds nominated a candidate with a strong resume, while the GOP nominee has weaknesses from his bid as the 2010 Lt. Gov. nominee. New York may produce perhaps the biggest turnaround of the cycle. Not since an ex-Buffalo Bills quarterback named Jack Kemp captured the seat in 1970 had a Democrat held it. Kathy Hochul changed that in a special election last year.But when a special master made her district, already the most Republican in the state even more so, she seemed like a dead duck. But now her personal popularity and unease with her opponent now make her seem like a good bet to return and if that were the case, the GOP would lose both seats via redistricting. Other “Empire State” freshman, particularly Nan Hayworth and Chris Gibson, may be more elusive.Redistricting increased Obama’s margin in both CD’s,though ironically, the party may have a better shot at ousting Hayworth (now 52% Obama) than Gibson (54%).Expect both to go down to the wire. Democrats have a few members of the New York delegation who can’t take their eye off the ball either (Tim Bishop and Bill Owens). Both know they’ll have to hustle, but, neither appears to be in perilous shape in areas that remain at just below 52% Obama(Owens gained swing counties such as Warren and Washington, but lost very conservative Oneida). Another Democrat who can’t hustle — at least literally (she broke her leg earlier in the year) is Louise Slaughter. But she has regained her strength and is favored in a district that, while substantially less Democratic than her previous territory, still gave Obama 58%. Rematches loom large in the House playing field as well and New Hampshire will be hosting two of them. Charlie Bass is a quintessential moderate who has done everything possible to appeal to his quintessential electorate. He also got his wish with a Romney nomination. But Bass was unseated once before and Kuster hasn’t stopped running since she fell a surprisingly 1% short in ’10. This time, she looks like a favorite. But a second New Hampshire seat may be more elusive. Frank Guinta has low approvals but the woman he unseated, Carol Shea-Porter, though a tenacious campaigner, appeals to some folks more than others in this unmistakbly mixed district. And yet another rematch looms in Michigan, where freshman Dan Benishek is trying to stave off Gary McDowell. Benishek’s margin in ’10 was 11%, but this district contains many seniors and,and even Republicans admit McDowell has improved from two years ago. Ds insist that Wisconsin-7 will eventually start moving in their direction, but, Walker performed well in the district and though Pat Kreitlow is a former Democratic St. Senator, Duffy appears to have recovered from early missteps. Still, state and national environments differ, and in the final analysis, this will go down to the wire. In Colorado, Mike Coffman’s old district fit him like a glove. But a Judge adopted the Democrats plan that carved Coffman out, and his rhetoric suggests he isn’t yet condusive to swing territory. The question is whether it’ll be vice-versa. Coffman has a big money edge but may have intimidated just enough swing voters for it not to matter. A second race in Colorado, where freshman Scott Tipton, may be a quintessential bellweather, and the national winds may loom large. In a newly created Nevada seat, Democratic nominee Steve Horsford may require national party assistance in the end but so far at least, seems to be running at least one step ahead of his Republican opponent. Democrats are also high on a second Nevada seat but John Oceguera recently had a dreadful performance in an interview with Nevada political guru Jon Ralston. Democrats are counting on a strong Election Day turnout, but the momentum has to be with Heck. And Arizona Dems are optimistic that Ann Kirkpatrick and the winner of a hotly contested primary for a new seat in the state will be able to start measuring drapes. They may, but again, the national climate will be very much ar work. Finally, the remap gave Washington State one additional seat and Republicans concede the Democrats are a lock to seize it. And much to their relief,a moderate named Suzanne DelBene has better odds of squeaking into the general election in the seat Jay Inslee vacated to run for Governor, than the very liberal, and very polarizing Darcy Burner. Now let’s look at the state’s where Democrats have an albatross around their necks. Right off the bat, the retirement of two ‘Blue Dogs” in Arkansas and Oklahoma will give the GOP two new seats, and with them, control of every seat in both delegations. The “Tarheel State”was the GOP’s biggest success story.Mapmakers redrew the lines that, if successful, would make a 7-6 Democraic delegaion 10-3 Republican.For Republicans,two of those seats have all but officially come to fruition (NC-11 and NC-13). A third seat, held by Democrat Larry Kissell may also fall Republicans way but Kissell is proving at least somewhat more elusive than the GOP expected. Still, a hold would be a tall order. Both sides feel they can win NC-7, where Republicans put eight-termer Mike McIntyre in an unenviable position.A GOP poll has McIntryre leading by 4% while one for the Dems.shows him up by 18%.Romney will dominate voting here,so if folks mount a straight ticket vote ,McIntyre could be in trouble. Ditto for John Barrow in Georgia.Republicans reversed the 54% Obama-McCain numbers, but Barrow can’t be called a liberal. He is currently awaiting his opponent, but this one might go down to how much the top of the ticket gets decimated. In Utah,Matheson is forced to contend with a different kind of situation. Opponent Mia Love is an articulate, poised, and rare African-American Republican. Matheson will have to contend with Romney’s coattails. One incumbent Democrats do not believe will be coming back is Leonard Boswell. But another member vs. member race is giving the Democrats more optimism. A Libertarian who drew 7% against Renacci last time is on the ballot again, and that would come from Renacci. But while Obama won’t carry the district (he lost it 51-48%) last time, Sutton will need him to run at least semi-well, which is quite uncertain. Renacci has a slight edge but this one is far from over. Oddly, Democrats are confronted with headaches in the region that should be far and away their strongest:the Northeast.Incumbents John Tierney and David Ciccilline have problems. The odds of Tierney returning grow dimmer every day but Ciccilline may get boost from the top of the ticket. Holding Connecticut-5 will not be the slam dunk the party once envisioned, but as long as early favorite Chris Donovan doesn’t get any further intwined in the scandal that’s already encompassed some top aides (provided he wins the nomination), he may ride this one out. Democrats do have several surprise opportunities. Thad McCotter’s surprise, somewhat involuntay retirement and the likely nominee of a Tea-Party gives Ds big hope in a district that gave Obama. Snatching that seat would mean that the “Wolverine State’s” loss of a seat would come from the GOP column, not, as was previously certain, the Democrats.And the Democrats’ biggest hope of all, which would be worth 5 seats is a Bachmann defeat. MY cHRYSTAL Ball shows a 51-49% race either way. Incidentally, Steve king Vilsack’s husband carried the area in his 2002 Gubernatorial victory, but the evangelical community The bottom line. When the dust settles,Democrats may still gain about 6 seats,but that would be less than half of what had been realistictly hoped for months ago.It may even resemble 1996, when Bill Clinton was winning re-election but the party was gaining less than half the seats necessary. Whatever the case, true Democratic faithful are likely to be disappointed and looking toward 2014.", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Note: Normal people might find some of this offensive. (We hope. Dear Lord, please!) One of the reasons we call liberals the alt-left is their opposition to anything traditional or normal -- like free speech, patriotism or marriage. Marriage has been a particular target of the left for many years. Forget the campaign for gay marriage. The left hates the institution, but it’s easier to wreck it from within than without. As The Establishment puts it, “marriage sits at the red-hot heart of our, ahem, white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy.” Stop laughing. They actually believe this garbage. Katie Tandy, the co-founding editor (or is that confounding editor?), delivered this unique take on weddings: “What Does Marriage Mean When You’re Gender-Fluid (And Loathe The Patriarchy)?” Apparently, that it means you need serious help was not one of the multiple choice answers. I feel like this column needs a soundtrack to fit in with the ridiculous text and subtext. Cue Frank Sinatra singing Love and Marriage, which TV fans will recognize as the theme for Married With Children. Or, perhaps, Modern Love by David Bowie. Now, if you are in the proper mood, let’s hear Ms./Mx. Tandy’s view of wedding day: “Weddings are, in short, a painful reminder of the sanctioned discrimination that runs rampant in our country, tangling gender, class, identity, and sexuality in a morass of white lace and marzipan flowers.” Or, the shortened version, she says, “the oppressive shadow of Marriage looms large.” And that brings us to The Establishment’s take on a brand-new movie you are probably dying to see. “Which is why I was genuinely thrilled to learn about D.I.Y.—a film about a gender-fluid couple deftly wrestling with their pending nuptials and what the hell it all means in this day and age.” Genuinely thrilled? I know you will be shocked to discover that the movie was“written by actors and dear friends Sarah McCarron and Yuval Boim (who, incidentally, are both gay).” Incidentally… In fact, that’s why they are making the film. “We’re making this because we’re both gay and we wanted to tell a story about marriage, which up until now has been a heterosexual institution. But we wanted to tell it from the queer perspective,” explained Yuval. You certainly get that much. The article goes into detail about pegging, which you’ll recall I described in a column last year. Here’s the lovely definition: “a woman performing anal sex on a man by penetrating him a strap-on dildo.” Now to a caption in this article: “Sometimes love is pegging.” Nope. But, your mileage may vary. And that demented worldview leads us to other interesting nuggets from the alt-left. Jeremy Lin’s Dreaded Dreadlocks: The beauty of cultural appropriation is two-fold. First, everybody does it. Foods that one ethnic group like become mass marketed, as do clothes, music styles and even holidays. I love some Mexican food or Tex-Mex. Yet, I’m hardly Hispanic. However, it’s only fair because I see tons of people who aren’t Irish-Americans celebrating St. Patrick’s Day along with Irish-Americans like myself. (I actually prefer Mutt-Americans, which goes for all of us who, like me, have several ethnic backgrounds.) And no one cares. At least, no one sane cares. That leads us to the race-baiting left. They care. Selectively. It was amusing when Dennis Rodman and Jason Kidd dyed their hair blond. No one was hurt or offended. Beyonce dyes her hair blonde and not only is no one offended, Essencemagazine is telling women how they can do the same dye job. What’s good for the Queen Bey is not equally good for others. Over at The Root, they are upset about the big news. Here’s the lede, actual quote: “Jeremy Lin has dreadlocks.” Horrors, am I right? No? You don’t understand. Lin is of Taiwanesedescent. Yeah, I didn’t care either. But The Root does. It followed that four-word lede with 85 words of filler and then: “What the fuck?” Never a publication known for subtlety, it hit the point again, harder. “Again, for the readers just joining us: Jeremy Lin, the Chinese-American basketball player, has motherfucking dreadlocks.” Former NBA star Kenyon Martin joined in the race shaming. “Do I need to remind this damn boy that his last name Lin?” Note the use of “boy” and imagine Lin had used that term on an African-American player. Then picture the outrage. Author Michael Harriot spends nearly 800 words calling Lin out for his haircut. Harriot purports to ask journalistic questions, all in this vein: “Specifically: Nigga, what?” Yep, the rest of the article disparages Lin based on his race and even the basketball skill of a guy who has nearly 5,0 careerNBA points. It turns out liberals never care about the content of your character. They only care if you offend them. And they are always offended by something. Mansplaining About Evils of Mansplaining: “Mansplaining has become one of the defining phenomena of the 21st century,” according to Lifehacker, apparently a site for hipster doffuses. (Doofi?) It’s one of Haim Saban’s silly sites and it certainly lives down to that rep. What we get is Tim Donnelly, presumably a man (but it is a lefty site, so who knows?), mansplaining about mansplaining. Liberals call mansplaining, “the intersection between overconfidence and cluelessness where some portion of that gender gets stuck.” In reality, it’s an alt-lefty way to discriminate against men and sound hip trendy at the same time. We are told it’s a newly diagnosed evil in this actual quote: “But the problem with mansplaining is that until very recently, it’s been a largely unlabeled and pernicious part of society.” In words the article disdains, well, actually, that means you only recently got offended. The Lifehacker answer to mansplaining? “Basically stay off Twitter forever.” Yes, Lifehacker, which has 4.24 million followers on Twitter and has tweeted nearly 60,0 times, tells you to stay off Twitter. It even tweetedthis article telling you to stay off Twitter. Here’s the author’s mansplaining of that suggestion, actual quote two: “Twitter is lousy with mansplainers because the structure of the site makes it easy to immediately disagree with someone without knowing anything about them.” So Twitter is like every bar or stadium ever? Maybe don’t stay off Twitter, but you might stop following Lifehacker. &lt;&lt;&lt; Please support MRC's NewsBusters team with a tax-deductible contribution today. &gt;&gt;&gt; DONATE Getting Rid Of Latino And Latina: The X rating might be gone, but apparently it still has an impact. Alt-lefties are working hard at adding the scarlet letter to terms like Mr. or Mrs. and now Latina or Latino. (See above, where I slipped it into the text.) Salon shows us how: “Forget About ‘Latino’ — why I’m all for ‘Latinx,’ and you should be, too.” The article begins complaining about the Spanish language. “Masculine is usually the default for people. But should it be?,” went the beginning of the argument. Here’s the cruX of the argumenX: “In response to the male-dominant Spanish language, feminist and queer Spanish speakers of Latin American descent devised a gender-neutral alternative to ‘Latino,’ which is masculine in nature. And that’s ‘Latinx’ (pronounced La-tEEn-ex).” Well, that’s helpful. It’s pronounced like Kleenex and not like new, Hispanic member of the X-Men. Naturally, you can credit alt-lefty media for promoting this language silliness. “Even the New York Times couldn’t resist using it (sparingly, of course). It shouldn’t be long until the Associated Press has something to say, too.” That last part is probably true. Lefty AP is the reason why neutral media won’t call pro-life groups “pro-life.” Ultimately, this is about liberals promoting life “outside the gender binary,” which if you’ve seen some of the left-wing protest marches, might be understandable. Here’s a detailed PC description that is almost mind-numbing: “They might identify as gender nonconforming (or GNC, an umbrella term for people who don’t follow societal norms around the gender they were assigned at birth), non-binary (a term for all genders that aren’t male or female), gender queer (similar to GNC folks who don’t adhere to the binary) or gender fluid (refers to people whose gender changes; they might identify as female today and male or non-binary tomorrow). They’d likely receive the Mx. title in the Times and use pronouns.” I imagine the people who run GNCjust adore this term. One “expert” defended the term as, “Because this is a word we’re going to be using to respect gender diversity.” Thanks for the clarity. I’ll stick with Latino and Latina then.

{"text": "It didn’t quite garner the same media highlight, but nevertheless there was the unmistakable comparison this week between the evacuation of American troops from southern Afghanistan and the Fall of Saigon, South Vietnam, in 1975. Both events mark embarrassing retreats by a failing American empire whose hubris always manages to deny reality until the illusion of power finally comes crashing down. This week thousands of US and British troops were hurriedly airlifted from the giant military base known as Camp Bastion in southern Helmand Province. It was a huge logistical operation involving a fleet of transport planes and helicopters landing and taking off over a 24-hour period. The scene of hasty imperial removal from Helmand reminded one of the classic photographs taken in 1975 by UPI photographer Hubert Van Es, which captured American Huey choppers lifting hundreds of desperate personnel from off the rooftop of the CIA headquarters in Saigon ahead of imminent defeat by Vietnamese insurgents. This week in Helmand the evacuating troops were the last of the US-led NATO force that has occupied Afghanistan for the past 13 years. At its peak, there were 140,0 American troops in the country with the second biggest contingency being the British, along with soldiers from nearly 50 other nations. Now Camp Bastion has been handed over to Afghan troops and police, who will take over the daunting task of maintaining security across the country against a deadly resurgence of Taliban militants. Officially, the US-led international force is to wind down its operation in Afghanistan at the end of this year, but some 10,0 American military and CIA will remain in the country in a “support role” to national security forces under a deal signed between Washington and the new Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. Just like the Fall of Saigon in April 1975, in which thousands of American personnel were scrambled out the country ahead of the Vietnamese victory, the retreat from Afghanistan this week signals another humiliating defeat for the warmongers in Washington. Not only a humiliating defeat, but the end of a long and bloody chronicle of futile war. Thirteen years ago, the Americans invaded Afghanistan allegedly to topple a fundamentalist Taliban regime and eradicate an international source of terrorism led by Saudi al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. Tens of thousands of deaths later, plus trillions of dollars billed to the American taxpayers, the US troops are clearing out from a country that is left in worst shape. The American-installed government can barely maintain security in the capital, Kabul, never mind the surrounding regions. What’s more terrorism of the Al-Qaeda brand has spread internationally eliciting the deployment of even more American militarism abroad, and the ramping up of state security powers within the US and its NATO allies. In Afghanistan, the Taliban are resurgent not only in their southern heartlands, but have taken over large parts of the east, west and north of the country, where they previously had little presence. Schools and other civic administration in these areas are now reportedly run, not by the US-backed government in Kabul, but by the militants. Cultivation of poppy for heroin production – a main source of finance for the Taliban warlords – has reached an all-time high with over 200,0 hectares under cultivation. Nearly half of all Afghan poppy is harvested in Helmand Province, where US President Obama launched his much-vaunted surge of 30,0 extra marines in 2009-2010. Despite Washington spending $7.6 billion to curb poppy production, Afghanistan has emerged as the world’s biggest source of heroin, while drug addiction in the US is reportedly soaring. On security matters, between March and August this year, nearly 1,0 Afghan troops and 2,200 police officers were killed in militant attacks. That represents the worst casualty rate for local forces over the past 13 years. With the last of the US-led foreign forces pulling out this week, there is an ominous sense of the security levee bursting across Afghanistan. If anything, the prognosis for Afghanistan is a lot worse than it was for Iraq where US troops beat a similar hasty retreat three years ago. By comparison, Afghanistan has a much more active insurgency raging even as the Americans are pulling out. Iraq has gone on to descend into chaos, so the portent for Afghanistan would seem a lot worse. Reuters news agency reported the view of US Marine Staff Sergeant Kenneth Oswood, who participated in both the Iraq withdrawal and this week’s evacuation from Afghanistan. He said: “It’s a lot different this time. Closing out Iraq, when we got there, we were told there hadn’t been a shot fired in anger at us in years. And then you come here and they are still shooting at us.” The US marine added: “It’s almost like it’s not over here, and we’re just kind of handing it over to someone else to fight.” More like handing it over to someone else to do the dying. The “exceptional” Americans in Washington like to refer to their foreign interventions as “nation building.” Like Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, among dozens of other unfortunate countries to have hosted American “nation builders” over the past century, the people of these wretched lands have experienced Washington’s reverse Midas Touch. Far from turning to gold, everything Washington touches brings death and destruction. And in the end when the American destroyers finally pack up and run, it is the people that remain who must pick up the pieces and actually begin the real process of national development. How easier it would be if Washington just kept its imperialist, predatory hands off others. Published on Jan 10, 2014 Does Washington have any obligation toward Iraq and its people after a decade of western occupation? Should we expect Afghanistan and Iraq to be beholden to Washington and its western allies? And how has the occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq changed the Middle East?

{"text": "Today, Hershey closed down its Reading, PA plant after 23 years of production, and moved 300 jobs to Mexico. Teamsters President Jim Hoffa asked a good question, when are we going to tell these companies that enough is enough? Teamsters President Jim Hoffasaid, “That plant stood for decades in Reading, providing countless families with good wages and job security. Members of this community helped build that company and this is how they are repaid. Hershey’s actions are unconscionable in this economic climate. Pennsylvania lost nearly 60,0 jobs in the last quarter of 2008 and the estimate for the month was well over 30,0 jobs lost. When are we going to tell companies like Hershey that enough is enough?” It is interesting that this occurs on the same week where Obama visited Canada, and changed his tune on NAFTA. On the campaign trail Obama suggested withdrawing from NAFTA, but this week he said that he wants to do things that will grow trade between the U.S. and Canada, “I provided Prime Minister Harper an assurance that I want to grow trade, not contract it.” Obama said that he wants to change NAFTA without hurting trade. Hoffa asked a really good question. When is it enough? There isn’t much of a manufacturing sector in the United States, but I do give Obama credit for not selling the false bill of goods that other candidates have sold in the past, that he will bring the manufacturing sector back, but he can’t tell labor that he is against NAFTA while going to Canada and softening his tone. I don’t think that there is an easy answer here. I would expect more jobs to be leaving as state and local governments can no longer afford to give the generous tax cuts that have been used to lure these kinds of jobs in the past. What Hershey did in Reading was morally wrong, but corporations are not moral creatures. They are judged strictly based on profits, and moving jobs to Mexico increases profits. Obama wants to replace these jobs through his green economic plan. If this works, expect labor to be very happy with him, but should the green jobs be slow to materialize, Obama and organized labor could be on a collision course that only the passage of the Employee Free Choice Act would prevent.

{"text": "Russia’s state propaganda organ, RT (previously known as “Russia Today”), scooped Wikileaks yesterday on Wikileaks’ own story. On October 22, at 8:20AM Eastern Time, the Russians tweeted a new story of theirs about the Wikileaks Podesta emails. Then, 30 minutes later, at 8:50AM ET, Wikileaks announced itsnew Podesta emails to the world. In other words, the Russians broadcast the Wikileaks story to the world before Wikileaks itself, and the Russians even had enough noticeto write a story about it. (Twitter adjusts the time-stamp to the reader’s time zone — so the tweets below are time-stamped for my time zone, US Eastern time, and thus arein fact 30 minutes apart.) The suspiciouscorrelation between the two tweets was initially discovered by American hacker @th3j35t3r, who is commonly referred to as “the Batman of the Internet” for his attacks on America’s enemies. Here is Russia’s tweet — note the Russianseven had a story already written: And here is Wikileaks announcing the new emails, half an hour after the Russians already wrote a story about them: Trump and Wikileaks also had a little Twitter love fest yesterday evening: Many have speculatedabout the exact nature of the relationship between Wikileaks and Russian intelligence. Wikileaks denies any relationship; while US intelligence and private research firms have both concluded that the Clinton emails were stolen by Russia, with the likely intent of helping election Donald Trump, and more generally sowing confusing surrounding the US election. And just two weeks ago, Newsweek’s Kurt Eichenwaldcame to his own conclusion about Wikileaks and Russian intelligence: Wikileaks head Julian Assange has previouslyexpressed his preference for Donald Trump as president. From the NYT: The emails were released by WikiLeaks, whose founder, Julian Assange has made it clear that he hoped to harm Hillary Clinton’s chances of winning the presidency. In a separate NYTstory, Assange detailed why he preferred Trump over Clinton as president, and that he was releasing the emails in order to hurt Hillary’s electoral chances: Six weeks before the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks published an archive of hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of the Democratic convention, the organization’s founder, Julian Assange, foreshadowed the release — and made it clear that he hoped to harm Hillary Clinton’s chances of winning the presidency…. In the interview, Mr. Assange told a British television host, Robert Peston of the ITV network, that his organization had obtained “emails related to Hillary Clinton which are pending publication,” which he pronounced “great.” He also suggested that he not only opposed her candidacy on policy grounds, but also saw her as a personal foe. At one point, Mr. Peston said: “Plainly, what you are saying, what you are publishing, hurts Hillary Clinton. Would you prefer Trump to be president?” Mr. Assange replied that what Mr. Trump would do as president was “completely unpredictable.” By contrast, he thought it was predictable that Mrs. Clinton would wield power in two ways he found problematic. As a result of my questioning the odd timing of yesterday’sWikileaks and Russia Today tweets, Wikileaks has now blocked me on Twitter. Whither Wikileaks? In the past 24 hours, Wikileaks has been a virtual anti-Clinton propaganda machine. Tweet after tweet attacking Hillary, and the US generally: One tweet even proclaims that the US is “no longer a democracy.” I can’t say if Wikileaks has been compromised by the Russians. I can say that if I were the Russians, I’d be damn pleased aboutWikileaks’ efforts to get Donald Trump, the closest thing America has ever had to a fascist, elected president.

{"text": "Larry Hong is an intern in the Asia program at the Council on Foreign Relations and a senior at Columbia University. This is the second post in histhree-part series on the relationship between Hollywood and the Chinesefilm industry. Read part oneand part two. Chinese viewers have long been fascinated by Hollywood films. As a result, commercially successful U.S. films, such asTitanic, have often found success in Chinaas well. Even blockbusters that perform poorly in the United States often get a second chance to reclaim their worth when they are shown in the Chinese market.For example,Cloud Atlas, Bait 3D,andExpendables 3, all floundered in the United States, but managed to attract a sizable turnoutin China. This is not to say that every Hollywood production will succeed in China, but Chinese audiences can sometimes rescue Hollywood flops. Expertshave said that it is easy to achieve a good box office record in the country because cinema is still a relatively new form of entertainment for Chinese audiences. While this may have been true a few years ago, there are already subtle signsthat Chinese viewers are becoming more selective about the films they watch and responsive to product quality. In response, Hollywood studios have scrambled to lure Chinese audiences by incorporating more China-related elements and excludingelements that put China in an unsavory light; this strategy has been deployed with mixed results. More on: China Asia One important way that Hollywood studios include more “Chinese ingredients” is to cast Chinese actors in their movies. Historically, Chinese actors, especially female ones, have appeared in U.S. films as merely “ flower vases,” essentially decorative elements. This is the case, for example, of Chinese superstar Fan Bingbing’s all-too-brief appearance inX-Men: Days of Future Past, where her one and only line is “time’s up.” More recently, however, Chinese actors have started to play more substantialand visible roles. For example, Taiwanese singer and actor Jay Chou (whose career is primarily in mainland China) played the role of a magic store owner in the comedy heist movieNow You See Me 2. However, Chou’s part in the movie, visible as it might be, is insignificant and tangential to the main plot. More generally, as anAtlantic articleastutely noted, Chinese actors still primarily play supporting roles in Hollywood films, a situation that is unlikely to change in the near future. While Hollywood studios are interested in replicating the success of pan-Chinese films, such as the hugely popular Hong Kong action movies of the past century, they are much less invested in developing actors of Chinese (and more broadly Asian) descent. Tapping into Chinese talent is theoretically good for business and does not seem like a difficult task, but the industry is still bogged down by a deep resistance to change. As a result, often a Chinese-set, Chinese-staffed Hollywood film will still have a white actor as its face (see Zhang Yimou’sThe Great Wallfor the latest example of this). Even worse, white actors continue to star in the roles of Asian characters. In addition to casting Chinese actors, Hollywood is also including other “Chinese ingredients” to attract Chinese audiences. Movies that contain scenes in China are increasingly common. Chinese product placementsare also strategically inserted to resonate with Chinese viewers. For example, Chinese audiences watchingTransformers: Age of Extinctionwere amused by a profusion of local Chinese brands that appeared seemingly out of place including Chinese Red Bull, c’est bon water, Shuhua Milk, and China Construction Bank, just to name a few. Some movies such asIron Man 3andLoopereven contain a longer cuttailor-made for Chinese audiences. But many of these efforts to include Chinese elements are awkward and confusing. The extra footage inIron Man 3, which many Chinese audiences reported was irrelevant to the storyline, backfiredas the audiences felt “manipulated.” Similarly, Chinese audiences on Douban, China’s equivalent of Rotten Tomatoes, “gave a thumbs down” to the inclusion of artificial Chinese elements in the movieLooper. A more worrisome trend is that many of Hollywood’s apparent efforts to pander to Chinese audiences end up reinforcing Western stereotypes about China. The apocalyptic film2012, for a time the highest grossingfilm in Chinese history, was seen by many Chinese audiences as glorifyingChina’s role in saving the world from Armageddon. However, many criticswere quick to point out that this film actually reinforced Western misperceptions of Chinese as manual laborers. The 2016 sci-fi filmArrivalwas also seen by some Chinese audiencesas Hollywood’s latest attempt (after2012,Gravity,andThe Martian) to portray the Chinese as responsible for rescuing humanity from destruction by aliens. However, looking more closely, this film features an un-nuanced representation of China as a belligerent and revisionist power under the dictatorial control of General Shang, who made the unilateral decision to attack an alien spaceship; he only later backs down thanks to American linguist Louise’s “smart” intervention. This film also demonstrates another enduring and odd problem in Hollywood’s representation of China: the Chinese general is played by Hong Kong actor Tzi Ma, whose Mandarin betrays a thick Cantonese accent. How hard is it to find a competent Chinese speaker to play a Chinese role? Hollywood has a longstanding tendency to simplify, exaggerate, or distort cultural representations, going all the way back to the Classical Hollywood period. In that era, studios projected their own image of Asians – in the form of white actors in “yellow face” – onto the big screen. Today, Hollywood’s commercial impulse to get a bigger slice of the Chinese market often leads to the awkward insertion of cultural symbols and strategic deployment of stereotypical motifs. While China and Chinese brands and actors are increasingly represented in Hollywood movies, often they are still seen through the lens of Hollywood’s oriental imagination. Serious engagement with Chinese culture and serious investment in actors of Chinese descent remain absent from many Hollywood productions. As Chinese and American moviegoers become increasingly sophisticated, more nuanced modes of cross-cultural collaboration should be devised. More importantly, because of the historical significance of films in shaping cultural perceptions, incorrect cinematic representation can hamper accuratecultural exchange between the two countries. This we should avoid at all costs. More on: China Asia Over the weekend, the countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations held the Thirtieth ASEAN Summit, in Manila—the Philippines is the chair of ASEAN this year. As has become usual, much of the discussion before the summit centered on a potential joint statement about the South China Sea, which has become one of the most divisive issues in Southeast Asia. Countries growing closer to China, like Cambodia and Thailand (which also have no direct claims in the South China Sea), and those that have direct claims and are increasingly suspicious of Beijing’s activities, like Vietnam, have faced off over South China Sea statements at many ASEAN meetings.In addition, the summit provided an opportunity for Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to play up his role as a statesman and host. The fact that, over the weekend, U.S. President Donald Trump invited Dutertefor a White House visit, essentially praising Duterte for his brutal approach to narcotics and claiming that the two had a very friendly chat, only further bolstered Duterte’s image in the region—and probably at home. Duterte, of course, then reacted with bizarre mixed messages, making it sound likehe was too busy to visit the White House in the near future. This is probably bluster by the Philippine leader to make it clear that: he takes orders (or even invites) from no one; and, that he will continue to chart an independent foreign policy, even if he visits the White House. More on: Southeast Asia Philippines China South China Sea Some of the winners from the summit: 1. China While Southeast Asian states may still be divided about how to respond to China’s approach to the South China Sea—the region is witnessing a rapid arms race, led by countries like Vietnam, yet Beijing is supposedly pushing for a Code of Conduct, which seems to further befuddle many ASEAN nations—the ASEAN summit produced a relatively tepid statement on the Sea. In fact, the final statement was one of the most tepid on the South China Sea released by ASEAN in years. AsRapplerreported, “The ASEAN Chairman’s Statement on Sunday merely ‘took note of concerns expressed by some leaders over recent developments’ in the South China Sea.” Any discussion of China’s land reclamation projects in the South China Sea, which supposedly had been included in earlier drafts of the statement, was gone by the time the final statement was released. A reference to all partiesrespecting “legal and diplomatic processes” related to the South China Sea, essentially a reference to the need to respect last year’s Hague tribunal ruling, was gone by the time the final statement was released as well, another victory for Beijing. As theCambodia Dailynoted, the final statement also omitted a mention of China’s “militarization” of parts of the South China Sea and claimed that Southeast Asian states and China were cooperating more effectively on South China Sea issues—a dubious claim. 2. Rodrigo Duterte More on: Southeast Asia Philippines China South China Sea Duterte seems to have incurred little public backlash in the Philippines for shifting Manila’s approach to the South China Sea and Beijing in general—a strategy that was on display in the weeks leading up to the summit, and possibly at the summit as well. Earlier in April, Duterte had vowed to visit Thitu, an island in a disputed area of the South China Sea. Reportedly after pressure from Beijing, he abruptly cancelled his visit to Thitu. On Duterte’s watch, the ASEAN Summit then ultimately released a statement sure to please Beijing. Yet Duterte’s high popularity ratings at home seem unchanged, even though some data also suggests that Philippine citizens desire a tough approach to protecting Philippine claims in the South China Sea. 3. Thailand’s Military Timed to the ASEAN Summit, President Trump also called the leaders of Singapore and Thailand over the weekend and extended an invitation for a White House visit to them as well. The invitation for Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was completely uncontroversial. But Thailand’s prime minister is coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, the path to future elections in Thailand still seems unclear, and the military essentially enshrined its long-term power over government with the new constitution; any return to real and robust democracy in the kingdom is far off. Yet Prayuth’s legitimacy, and the Thai military’s actions, are going to essentially be endorsed by the White House with a visit to Washington. To be sure, former president Barack Obama included Prayuth as part of the U.S.-ASEAN summit last year in California. But Obama could at least claim that Prayuth was invited as part of the entire group of ASEAN leaders. Inviting the coup leader to the White House individually connotes a stronger endorsement of Prayuth. Roughly one year after Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) party took control of Myanmar’s parliament, and Suu Kyi became de facto head of state (Myanmar has a president, but Suu Kyi is widely known to control the government), the euphoria of last year has melted away. When the NLD won a sweeping electoral victory in November 2015, the country’s first truly free and accepted national elections in decades, it gained a massive majority in the lower house of parliament, as well as control of most of the country’s provincial legislatures. Myanmar citizens swept onto the streets of Yangon and other cities to celebrate. The military, which had ruled the country as a junta or a quasi-civilian regime between 1962 and 2015, publicly affirmed that it would accept the results of the election-and, in theory, a transfer of power to a civilian, Suu Kyi-led government. Suu Kyi, the democracy icon and Nobel Peace laureate who was kept under house arrest for years under military rule, had offered a broad slate of promises to the Myanmar public. She had vowed to aggressively push for a lasting peace deal with the country’s many ethnic insurgencies, some of which have been fighting the government for decades. “The first responsibility of the next government is to build peace,” she said in an address in January 2016. She had promised to protect threatened minorities, such as those Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine State. She had promised to build a developed country that did not rely on handouts of foreign aid, telling people on the campaign trail in 2015, “we don't want to be a country which needs to ask other countries for help.” More on: Asia Myanmar Human Rights Politics and Government Aung San Suu Kyi Yet in the past year, most of these promises have seemed hollow, and Myanmar’s stability, always fragile, appears to be disintegrating even more rapidly than it was in 2015. For more on my assessment of Suu Kyi’s first year in office, read my new article in The National. More on: Asia Myanmar Human Rights Politics and Government Aung San Suu Kyi More on: Asia United States Diplomacy and International Institutions Regional Organizations Indonesia Vice President Mike Pence, after a brief but relatively successful trip in Asia, rushed back to Washington ahead of schedule this week; the U.S. administration plans to tackle a very important set of domestic priorities including tax reform and keeping the federal government open. Pence reduced his time in Honolulu at the end of his trip. More important, as Reuters notes, portions of his trip in Indonesia and Australia were overshadowed by the increasingly tense environment in Northeast Asia, which now includes the reported chance of another North Korean missile or nuclear test Tuesday. As Reuters reports: Pence did have time in Indonesia to visit a mosque, talk up potential trade ties, and praise the country moderate religious practices and vibrant democracy-although Indonesia’s tolerance and secular democracy may have suffered a blow during the weeks before the Jakarta governor’s election. Pence also did affirm to Australian leaders that the Trump administration will uphold the refugee resettlement deal that the Obama administration drafted with Canberra. Pence also declared that “Australia is and always will be one of America’s closed allies and truest friends,” and during the visit to Asia he announced that the U.S. president would attend the ASEAN leaders’ summit in November in the Philippines, which is an important signal of Washington’s commitment to the region. Still, Pence’s time in Indonesia and Australia was overshadowed by crises in other parts of the region, other parts of the world, and the United States’ own rocky domestic politics-a kind of overshadowing of trips to Southeast Asia that has become the norm in recent years, no matter who is in charge in Washington. Barack Obama’s ASEAN summit in February 2016 was overshadowed by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and the immediate political wrangling in Washington during the aftermath of Scalia’s death. Other, previous visits to Southeast Asia and the Pacific by Obama were overshadowed by terrorist attacks in Paris, the fallout from Brexit, and-again-tensions in Northeast Asia. Many of the crises that have attracted attention from U.S. leaders during visits to Southeast Asia or summits with Southeast Asian leaders are outside of the control of U.S. policymakers, although the challenges in U.S. domestic politics certainly are not. But this repeated scenario-visits to the region cut short or dominated by events outside Southeast Asia-reinforce that it remains extremely challenging for any administration to place a more intense focus on ASEAN Australia. This is, after all, a region that is relatively stable, has no nuclear powers, and has, for four decades, been only a modest priority for U.S. policymakers. More on: Asia United States Diplomacy and International Institutions Regional Organizations Indonesia More on: China India Technology and Innovation North Korea South Korea Rachel Brown, Sherry Cho, Larry Hong, Gabriella Meltzer, and Gabriel Walker look at five stories from Asia this week. 1. Anies elected Jakarta’s next governor. Anies Baswedan, Indonesia’s former education minister, beat out sitting governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (better known as Ahok) in a closely contested election. While official results have not yet been released, Anies clearly leads in polls. This year’s gubernatorial campaign was plagued by ethnic and racial tensions. Ahok, a Christian of Chinese descent, was accused of blasphemy for remarks made in September regarding a Koranic verse. And although he garnered the largest share of votes in the first round of voting in February, he did not win the necessary simple majority. In the subsequent runoff race, religion may have played a decisive role in his defeat; Anies, who is Muslim, placed second in February and may have gained votes from supporters of third-place candidate Agus Yudhoyono, who is also Muslim. Ahok’s trial is ongoing, but he is unlikely to face jail time even if found guilty. Observers worry that the election results may empower conservative Islamic groups in both in the city itself and across the nation. The divisive role of religion and ethnicity in the Jakarta campaign could also foreshadow similar frictions in the 2019 presidential election. For now, the new mayor will face not only the challenge of uniting the city, but also of addressing a range of problemsincluding those involving public education and urban infrastructure. 2. India’s women-to-men ratio expected to decline rapidly. According to a report released this week by the Indian government, the ratio of women to men among those ages fifteen to thirty-four is expected to drop precipitously over the course of the coming decades. According to data from both the Indian government census and the World Bank, the ratio will drop from 939 girls per 1,0 boys to only 898 girls per 1,0 boys by 2031. This stark gender imbalance is a result of the decades-long practice of female infanticide, evidence of which began to appear when ultrasounds were first introduced to the country in the 1980s. Parents’ strong preference for male children is based on perceptions that only males will be able to financially care for their parents in old age, that family lineage should be passed through sons, and that the practice of dowries will “financially cripple” families. Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the Population Foundation of India, remarked that many Indian families are still choosing to have boys despite declining fertility rates, even asincomes and education levels rise. Although the practice of prenatal sex determination was officially banned in 1994, its enforcement has been lax at best. 3. Bluster billows over USS Carl Vinson bluff. Sparking ridicule and bewilderment throughout Asia, the revelation that the Pentagon did not send the USS Carl Vinsoncarrier directly toward North Korea, as U.S. officials had stated, also sparked questions about the coherence of the U.S. strategy toward North Korea. The reveal on Wednesday—that the carrier strike group was actually thousands of miles awayand had been heading away from South Korea—caused many in South Korea to question the Trump administration’s leadership and strategy in Asia. It also caused turmoil in South Korea during an already turbulent election period. After South Korea’s Defense Ministry declined to comment substantively on the issue, critics accused the ministry of aggravating anxieties in an election where North Korea’s nuclear program and Seoul’s close military relationship with Washington have been central issues. In China, the USS Carl Vinson episode prompted ridicule on social and news media, much of it directed at the perceived gullibility of foreign media and the Trump administration’s attempts to stymie Pyongyang. The incident provoked much less coverage in Japan, with many top officials declining to comment on the level of communication with Washington regarding policy toward North Korea. The USS Carl Vinson is now on its way to the Korean peninsula and is expected to arrive in the region next week. 4. Support slips for Duterte’s drug war. The latest public opinion pollon Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war shows declining—though still high—support. 78 percent of respondents reported they were satisfied with the government’s crackdown on illegal drugs, down from 85 percent in a similar poll taken inDecember 2016. The amountof dissatisfied respondents rose from 8 to 12 percent. The poll also shows that 73 percent of Filipinos were worried that they or someone they know would be a victim of extrajudicial killing. Since assuming office on June 30, 2016, President Duterte has put in place a controversial drug policy that involves calling upon Filipinos to kill drug addicts and suspected criminals. Since the implementation of the policy, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International have criticized the drug war on a number of grounds, including extrajudicial killings, disproportionate targeting of the poor, and fabrication of police evidence. Despite these alarming features, however, support for the drug war has remained high, including among young, liberal Filipinos. In response to the latest decline in public satisfaction, Presidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella said that “there seems to be consistency in the way the public appreciates the [anti-drug] efforts.” 5. Baidu to share self-driving car technology. Chinese search giant Baidu has been steadily expanding its AI research and investment in self-driving vehicles in recent years. This week, Baidu announced it will go one step further by releasing a platform for self-driving cars to the public this July. The platform, named Apollo, will provide access to systems for mapping, operations, and vehicle control. Initially the technology will only be available for use in limited areas, but ultimately the hope is to make it accessible for all road types by the end of the decade. Industry analysts see the move as a way for Baidu to accelerate the production of self-driving cars, assume an important role in the supply chain for such vehicles, and collect and analyze data on how the cars operate. Other major Chinese internet companies including Alibaba and Tencent have also been investing in the autonomous vehicle sector, along with firms in the United States and Europe. But open-source technology could help push Baidu closer to beating out competitors. Already car manufacturers in China, Germany, and the United States are reportedly interested in using the Apollo platform. Baidu’s decision to grant open access to its information is not without precedent. Tesla granted access to its patents to accelerate the development of the electric car market, and Google made its Android platform open source as well. Bonus: South Korea swaps coins for cards. On Thursday, South Korea took an important step on the road to a coinless—and possibly even cashless—future. Beginning this week, customers at some popular stores, such as CU, 7-Eleven, and Lotte Department Stores, can elect to deposit their small change onto cards rather than receiving it in coins. If the limited trial is successful, change could be deposited directly into bank accounts as early as next year. The shift would not only streamline shoppers’ transactions, but also save the government nearly $50 million a year that it would normally spend on minting coins. Even before the trial began, South Korea had the foundation for transitioning into a cashless society: according to the Bank of Korea, only 20 percent of payments are made with cash, over 60 percent of South Koreans do not use coins, and the rate of credit card ownership is relatively high at around 1.9 per citizen. Other Asian governments, such as those in Singapore and India, are also pushing to reduce the size of their cash economies to cut costs or combat tax evasion and corruption.

At last, Myanmar–China pipeline opens for business. This Tuesday, the first drops of crude oil began their slow northward crawl through a new pipeline connecting the Burmese coast to the southern Chinese city of Kunming. After nearly three years of remaining empty, the 480-mile-long, $1.5-billion pipeline will carry up to 260,0 barrels’ worth of crude a day to a refinery owned by the state-owned PetroChina, China’s largest oil producer. The pipeline will also help China address its “ Malacca dilemma,” the fact that the country’s oil imports come primarily through the Malacca Strait and disputed South China Sea. The new Myanmar pipeline has the capacity to supply nearly 6 percent of China’s daily crude, and should allow PetroChina to boost exports of refined products over the coming years. One analyst argues that while the benefits Myanmar enjoys from the project will likely be minimal in the short term—mostly revenues from tariff fees—the experience of building and operating a large-scale energy project with China could help develop Myanmar’s domestic capacity for similar infrastructure development in the future. Local residents, on the other hand, are less thrilled with the project: activists in both Kunming and Myanmar have challenged the refinery and pipeline, respectively.

Disappearances disturb in Malaysia.Widely circulated CCTV footage of what appears to be the abduction of a Malaysian pastor, Raymond Koh, as well as subsequent revelations of other disappearancesin the country, is unnerving many citizens and rights groups. Mr. Koh, who runs a nongovernmental organization called Harapan Komuniti, or “Hope Community,” in Kuala Lumpur, has been missing since the morning of February 13. Unlike a normal abduction, however, no ransom amount or information was offered, even though the Mr. Koh’s family offered a RM100,0 (around $23,0) reward. This unusual incident led the pastor’s son to fear the worst: that his father had been murdered. Following the highly publicized disappearance of pastor Koh, several other cases of disappearances surfaced. They include social activist and former Petaling Jaya City Councillor Peter Chong, Pastor Joshua Hilmy and his wife, and social activist and the founder of a nongovernmental organization Amri Che Mat. In the absence of a clear rationale for what some called “unprecedented” disappearances and the apparent lack of official efforts in locating these missing individuals, the Malaysian Bar says that there are “alarming doubts on the adequacy of the safety and security measures of the country” and even speculates that these missing cases might be “forced disappearances,” a politically charged term used to describe the disappearance of individuals by or with the acquiescence of state officials. In response to the allegations, Malaysia’s police force has denied any connections between these five individuals and cautioned the public against “unverified rumors.” 3. Japan’s population poised to take a steep dive. The Japanese National Institute of Population and Social Security Research (NIPSSR), which updates its country-wide figures every five years, has reported this week that Japan’s population is expected to fall from over 127 million today to merely 88 million people by 2065, and 51 million by 2115. This potentially drastic drop-off is based ondecades of declining birth rates dating back to the 1960s. However, the population decline is not as rapid as previously anticipated, as a growing number of women in their thirties are choosing to have children. That said, this particular demographic bump will not bring about a substantial change, as NIPSSR argues that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will need to implement better national policies to enhance child care, improve work-life balance, and integrate the elderly into the economy, as well as those to promote mass immigration. As of right now, immigrants are primarily short-term students and guest workers. Japan is struggling with an aging demographic in which adults aged sixty-five and over currently comprise roughly 30 percent of the population, reducing the country’s workforce and creating a heavy demand for pension funds. 4. Duterte walks back assertive Spratly statements. On April 6,Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte stated his intent to order troops to occupy and fortify islands and reefs within the Spratly Island chain in the South China Sea, along with his intent to personally visit Pagasa island to plant a Philippine flag on June 12, Philippine independence day. The comments, made during a press briefing after a military camp visit in Puerto Princesa, Palawan, the province on the front lines of the maritime dispute with China, appeared to be directed at Chinese encroachment in the Philippine Pacific coast. The Philippines and China possess competing claims to islands and features within the South China Sea; Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Vietnam also have claims within the South China Sea. On April 10, Duterte sought to allay concerns over his remarks by clarifying that he had “ordered the occupation of the ten or nine islands that are just near our shores” and also stating that no offensive weapons would be placed on those islands. Additionally, on an April 13speech in Saudi Arabia, he retracted his vow to personally raise a Philippine flag on Pagasa “because of our friendship with China.” Mr. Duterte’s initial statements perplexed many, as he has generally sought to bring the Philippines closer to Beijing in contrast to the approach of previous Philippine administrations. 5. New data transfer rules proposed in China. The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s top internet regulator, put forth Measures for the Security Assessment of Outbound Transmission of Personal Information and Critical Data this week. The measures stipulate that foreign companies operating online networks in China will need to apply for permission and undergo a security assessment before exporting data that either relates to more than 500,0 individuals, is tied to key national scientific projects or infrastructure, or exceeds one terabyte in size. The Chinese government will then decide whether to allow the transfer based on potential harm to the country’s economic development, political system, or national security. These regulations are consistent with previous restrictions on the Chinese internet including the 2016 Cybersecurity Law, but are notable for expanding the application of data localization rules beyond companies in “critical infrastructure” to encompass all operators. While some have hailed the new regulations as a means to counter security threats and protect digital rights, most observers are more skeptical and see them as further step in the government’s promotion of “internet sovereignty” and efforts to restrict foreign technology companies. The draft regulation remains open for public comment through May 11, 2017. In the past, some Chinese cybersecurity regulations have been watered down in response to criticism during this public comment period. Internet service providers and technology companies will no doubt be waiting anxiously to see if that pattern will repeat this time. Bonus: Indonesian artist sneaks political message into X-Men. The creators behind X-Men: Gold, a 2017 reboot of Marvel’s well-known comic series, were touted as an “ all-star creative team.” But the illustrator of the series’ first issue, Reddit users revealed this week, had more in mind than crafting action-packed panels. Ardian Syaf, a freelance Indonesian artist for Marvel, inserted at least two politically and religiously charged cryptic messages into the comic: one that referenced a Quran passage that hardline Indonesian Islamists use to defend their views of non-Muslims, and another that referenced a protest in Jakarta against the city’s Christian governor. After becoming aware of the hidden messaging, Marvel confirmed that the references would be erased in future editions of the comic and immediately terminated Syaf’s contract. Though Syaf denied any anti-Christian or anti-Semitic sentiment on Facebook, photos of him meeting with the leader of a controversial hardline Islamist group also surfaced online. Another illustrator, who has worked on Marvel artwork before, stated that sneaking political opinions into comics was nothing new, but “this episode definitely did not fit into Marvel’s storytelling.” More on: China Japan Cybersecurity Malaysia Human Rights", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Over the weekend, Donald Trump told voters in California, a state that is now suffering through its fifth year of drought, that “there is no drought.” Instead, Trump says, the state is suffering from harmful policies crafted by environmentalists. Or, in Trump-speak, “they’re taking the water and shoving it out to sea.” A lot of outlets pilloried the remarks. The Atlantic said they were “ beneath contempt.” Slate called them “ oblivious.” But Trump has gotten far too much credit. He’s not being his usual creative self. He’s just repeating an argument that’s been popular among conservatives for years. Ex-Republican-darling Carly Fiorina made this same argument repeatedly during her brief presidential run, calling the California drought nothing more than a “man-made disaster.” Conservative media, including Fox News, National Review,and the Wall Street Journal, have long takenaim at environmentalists for exacerbating the drought. Think of it as off-brand climate denialism. Drought deniers believe overzealous environmentalists got California into this mess. State and federal conservation laws call for a certain minimum level of freshwater to flow through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in Northern California, where two of the state’s largest rivers meet. Drought deniers say there’s an easy fix to the state’s water problems — take away those laws and divert more of that water to the agriculture industry. The longstanding symbol at the center of this fight is the delta smelt, a three-inch-long fish protected under the Endangered Species Act. Roughly half of the water that flows through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is supposed to be left to sustain the delta smelt and the broader environment, and the rest is to be divided for human uses like agriculture and household consumption. But that’s in a normal year; in recent drought years, California has already been making exceptions to regulatory safeguards. The U.S. House of Representatives is now considering a bill to amend the Endangered Species Act and allow even more water to be redirected to the dry Central Valley and Southern California. Even Senate Democrats are considering a bill that would give the federal government more leeway to divert water for human use. But as water from the delta makes its way out to the ocean, it doesn’t just nurture the delta smelt. By supporting the whole ecosystem, it supports fishing industries as well. The health of the delta smelt population is a rough approximation of the health of the ecosystem and other species in it, including salmon, and right now that health is poor. Ironically, even the quality of human drinking water would be negatively affected by diverting more water from the delta for human use. Letting farmers and other interests use as much water as they want wouldn’t begin to solve the larger problems posed by drought and climate change. It wouldn’t suddenly mean there is more snowpack and rain. It wouldn’t make California any less hot. In fact, this Band-Aid approach might only make California worse off in the decades to come, as megadroughts become a reality; if the state doesn’t figure out how to conserve water now, it will only have more problems down the road. So it isn’t as simple as Trump promises: “If I win, believe me, we’re going to start opening up the water so that you can have your farmers survive.” Trump and other drought deniers have another thing in common: They tend to ignore the role of climate change in making California’s drought more extreme, and reject climate science altogether. They are certain that the drought is man-made, but they’re still unconvinced that humans have caused climate change.", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Former FBI Director and confirmed leaker James Comey appears to be following the Washington Post reporter who broke the “Russian hacking” story. She also reported Wednesday’s allegation that Trump is under investigation for possible obstruction of justice. On Wednesday evening, the Washington Post published a story alleging that a special counsel is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice — citing unnamed sources. One of four reporters who worked on the story was Ellen Nakashima — whose recent reporting for the publication has a sharp focus on Comey. Trending: Rod Rosenstein Submitted False Documents To Senate Concerning His Interrogation of Hillary Clinton The story claims that “Trump had received private assurances from then-FBI Director James B. Comey starting in January that he was not personally under investigation. Officials say that changed shortly after Comey’s firing.” The article relies entirely on leaked information from anonymous sources. In March, Comey revealed that he has secret Twitter and Instagram accounts — which he stated both have very few followers. Within hours, Gizmodo journalist Ashley Feinberg had tracked down accounts that appeared to belong to Comey — using the name Reinhold Niebuhr. When it was discovered by Feinberg, the Twitter account, @projectexile7, was following 27 people, and followed by just one person — Benjamin Wittes of Lawfare, who happens to be a personal friend of Comey. The account did not have any identifying information, and was simply an egg account without a photo. Following Gizmodo’s explosive report, the account’s followers boomed to over 7,0 before the account was set to private and locked down from public viewing. As Feinberg reported, Comey was following several journalists who were aggressively covering the FBI’s work on the Democrats’ Trump-Russia witch hunt. Among them were the Washington Post’s Nakashima and David Ignatius, as well as Adam Goldman and David Sanger of the New York Times. But Nakashima is the one who broke the “Russia hacking” story, and now the new “obstruction of justice” story. Nakashima was the one who first reported that “Russian hackers” broke into the Democratic National Committee servers to steal their Trump opposition files, a Twitter user who goes by “@GOPPollAnalyst” noted. In the article, Nakashima cited anonymous “US officials” who had informed her that “networks of presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were also targeted by Russian spies.” “Russian government hackers penetrated the computer network of the Democratic National Committee and gained access to the entire database of opposition research on GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump,” Nakashima wrote on June 14, 2016. Interestingly, the possible Comey account also liked a tweet from the New York Times about General Mike Flynn and Jared Kushner meeting a Russian envoy. The report cited anonymous “current and former American officials” who claimed that Flynn “had contacts with Mr. Kislyak during the campaign.” During Comey’s much anticipated hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, the former FBI Director admitted to giving his memo about his meeting with the president to a friend so that they could leak the information to the press. He claimed that he did so in order to prompt the appointment of a special counsel to investigate links between the administration and Russia. In response to Comey’s shocking admission, Trump’s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz released a statement saying that the former FBI Director was trying to “undermine this administration with selective and illegal leaks of classified information and privileged communications.” We reached out to Nakashima for comment, but did not receive a response by time of publishing.", "label": "true"}
{"text": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declared Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional, a major blow to supporters of oversight of voting laws that they say protects against discrimination. The ruling in Texas means that now the state's controversial law requiring voters to present photo identification before casting a ballot can be implemented. Section 4 applies to the formulas that determine which territories are subject to preclearance by Congress under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, including Texas. Section 5 is the reason the state’s legislative and congressional district maps, as well as its voter ID law, have been on hold or subject to court battles. The court ruled in an Alabama case, Shelby County v. Holder, that the formulas used to determine whether voting laws should be reviewed should no longer apply. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. \"Congress did not use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula grounded in current conditions,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the 5-4 opinion. \"It instead re-enacted a formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relationship to the present day.\" Although the court did not issue an opinion on Section 5, the ruling makes that section null and void, said Michael Li, an attorney and editor of the Texas Redistricting blog. “The chief justice says pretty clearly in his opinion it can no longer be used as a basis for review,” he said. The court took \"the easier path,” he added, by not directly addressing Section 5. SCOTUS Blog writer Amy Howe wrote in her analysis: “Thus, although Section 5 survives, it will have no actual effect unless and until Congress can enact a new statute to determine who should be covered by it.” Attorney General Greg Abbott, who has already challenged the federal government on voter ID, immediately posted a celebratory message on Twitter. “With today's #SCOTUS decision #Texas should be freed from Voting Rights Act Preclearance,” he tweeted. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Some Democrats lamented the decision and said it takes Texas back to the era of Jim Crow laws. \"It is an outrageous and nonsensical ruling,“ state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, said in a statement. “I don’t know what America those five Supreme Court justices are living in to be able to pretend that deliberate and blatant attempts to disenfranchise people of color at the ballot box do not exist. This is Plessy v. Ferguson for the 21st century and will go down in history as one of the most wrong-headed and out-of-line decisions of the modern era.” State Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, D-San Antonio, the chairman of the Mexican American Legislative Caucus, said in a statement that despite the setback, all is not lost — yet. \"While we are pleased that the court did not strike down Section 5, we are disappointed that the coverage formula was deemed unconstitutional,\" he said. \"We urge Congress to develop a new coverage formula that complies with the Supreme Court’s ruling in order to place states with a history of discrimination towards minorities under preclearance protections.\" In an official White House statement, President Obama said he was “deeply disappointed” in the high court’s ruling because, in part, a bipartisan Congress chose to renew the act’s key provisions for five decades. He said Tuesday’s actions, however, do not indicate that America’s fight to ensure the right to vote for every eligible citizen is over. “And while today’s decision is a setback, it doesn’t represent the end of our efforts to end voting discrimination,” he said.“I am calling on Congress to pass legislation to ensure every American has equal access to the polls. My administration will continue to do everything in its power to ensure a fair and equal voting process.” Li wrote in his analysis that Texas redistricting plans are likely headed for more controversy based on what state leaders are likely to do after Tuesday's decision. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. “The Texas Legislature completed the process this weekend of adopting the 2012 interim maps as permanent maps (with just the most minor of changes to the state house map),” he wrote. “Those bills now are on Gov. Perry’s desk, awaiting signature. On the other hand, right now, there is no longer any preclearance bar, and the maps passed by the Texas Legislature back in 2011 are technically legally operative. Gov. Perry now has to decide what to do next.” Section 5 of the Voting Rights Actapplies only to places — mostly states, but some counties — where there is a history of discrimination in the application of election laws. It requires those jurisdictions to win permission from a three-judge panel in Washington, D.C., or the U.S. Department of Justice before local laws that affect voting can be changed. Texas is one of16 states covered — in full or in part — under Section 5. The case does not affect another part of the law — Section 2 — that prohibits discrimination in election and voting law. The Texas secretary of state's office said last week that if SB 14, the voter identification law, was allowed to stand the office would immediately begin working to educate the public about the new voting requirements. Below is an updated timeline of actions and decisions affecting Texas’ voter ID law: March 23, 2011: SB 14 passes the Texas House following debate on more than 60 amendments and seven points of order. The House discussed the bill for about 12 hours. May 9, 2011: The Texas Senate adopts the voter ID conference committee report, which tweaked some of the amendments approved during the House floor debate. May 16, 2011: The Texas House approves the committee’s report, which removed a provision that would have allowed residences of federally recognized tribal lands to show their tribal IDs to vote. The bill’s House sponsor, Patricia Harless, R-Spring, also introduced an “outside-the-bounds resolution” that included a provision in which free IDs would be made available for the sole purpose of casting a ballot. A provision to exclude people who attest under oath they do not have their photos takes due to religious purposes was also adopted. July 2011: The Texas secretary of state’s office submits to the Justice Department the required request for preclearance. Because of Texas' history of racial discrimination, Section 5 of the federal Voting Rights Act gives the U.S. Department of Justice or the federal courts the authority to review laws that would affect voter participation. Fifteen other states are subject to the preclearance rule. August 2011: The National Conference of State Legislators issues a report explaining the differences in Texas’ law compared with others recently passed. The report concludes that only six other states, like Texas, have a strict photo requirement: Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Wisconsin, South Carolina and Tennessee. Seven states — Alabama, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan and South Dakota — ask voters for photo ID, but still allow them to cast a ballot if they don't have a photo ID and can meet other specific criteria. Sixteen other states require voters to show some form of ID, though not necessarily with a photo. “The law puts Texas in the group with Indiana and Georgia, which I would categorize as fairly strict,” Doug Chapin, an elections expert at the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs, told the Tribune. September 2011: Arguing the bill unfairly affects minorities and the elderly, a coalition of civil and rights groups writes the Justice Department, urging denial of the preclearance request. In a letter submitted during the public comment period by the Advancement Project, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Asian American Justice Centerand the Southwest Workers Union, the groups allege that instead of actually providing proof the legislation was enacted for non-discriminatory reasons, the state relied simply on its claim that officials did not intend on diluting the voting strength of minority groups. Perry’s office responds, saying: \"Voter ID was enacted to ensure the integrity of the ballot box, protecting the most cherished right we enjoy as citizens and ensuring our elections are fair beyond reproach. By applying to voting the same standard that is commonly applied in cashing a check or applying for a library card, Voter ID can ensure an accurate reflection of the will of the voters.” Sept. 23, 2011: The DOJ tells the Texas secretary of state’s office that it needs more information to render a decision on whether SB 14 will “have neither the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.\" Specifically, it wants to know details about the estimated 605,600 registered voters who do not currently possess a valid ID. The department asked the state to identify how many members of that group have Spanish surnames, which counties they reside in and an estimated number by race. The DOJ also requested that the state provide the number of registered voters in Texas with a Spanish surname who currently possess a legal form of identification. Oct. 5, 2011: The state responds and says it does not ask about voters' race when they register. Instead, the Texas secretary of state submitted a list of all the Hispanic surnames in Texas, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The state also offered to run that list against the list of registered voters to determine how many have Hispanic names, and it offered to use data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues driver's licenses, to assist in obtaining the information. Nov. 17, 2011: The Justice Department still isn’t satisfied and tells the state it wants more information. The state responds but tells the Tribune, “The state warned that the results would be skewed because DPS didn’t include a specific category for Hispanic drivers until 2009.” Dec. 13, 2011: U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder tells an audience at the LBJ Library at the University of Texas at Austin that the federal government will fight to ensure minority-voting rights are not eroded by actions of state legislatures. He says the Texas bill will undergo a fair and thorough review. December 2011: The American Civil Liberties Union files a suit in federal court challenging the state of Wisconsin’s voter ID law. ACLU attorneys allege that bill is less strict than the Texas proposal but will also disenfranchise minority and elderly voters. Nonetheless, a decision on the Wisconsin bill could be used as a guide to determine what other states can and cannot do. “This lawsuit is the opening act in what will be a long struggle to undo the damage done to the right to vote by strict photo ID laws and other voter suppression measures,” Jon Sherman, an attorney with the ACLU Voting Rights Project, said in a statement. “Across the nation, legislators are robbing countless American citizens of their fundamental right to vote, and in the process, undermining the very legitimacy of our democracy. Dec. 23, 2011: The Justice Department issues a ruling rejecting South Carolina’s voter ID law. Jan. 13, 2011: The state of Texas resubmits its request for preclearance, and the Justice Department has 60 days from this date to make a decision. Again, the state warns about the reliability of the data. “By requesting Spanish surname data, the DOJ’s request acknowledges that the DPS database does not accurately reflect the number of Hispanic voters in Texas who possess a driver’s license or photo identification card,” Keith Ingram, the director of the state’s elections division, wrote to the department. “Nonetheless, in a good faith attempt to satisfy the DOJ’s request, the State has compiled the requested data — despite the State’s reservations about the reliability of that data.” Jan. 23, 2012: Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott files suitagainst the U.S Department of Justice in an attempt to have the state’s voter ID law implemented immediately. “The U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that voter identification laws are constitutional,” Abbott said in a prepared statement. “Texas should be allowed the same authority other states have to protect the integrity of elections. To fast-track that authority, Texas is taking legal action in a D.C. court seeking approval of its voter identification law.” Abbott says his office will drop the suit if preclearance is granted. March 7, 2012: The Texas secretary of state tells the Tribune that the state will be ready to have the required outreach and voter-education requirements in place by the May 29 primary if the preclearance request is granted. “As I understand it, they have three options: They can issue preclearance, they can deny preclearance or they can request more information,” said Rich Parsons, a spokesman for the secretary of state. Aug. 30, 2012: A three-judge panel in Washington, D.C., rejects Texas' voter ID law. “We find that Texas has failed to make this showing — in fact, record evidence demonstrates that, if implemented, SB 14 will likely have a retrogressive effect,” the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia judges wrote in their opinion. “Given this, we have no need to consider whether Texas has satisfied section 5’s purpose element. Accordingly we deny the state’s request for a declaratory judgment.” September 2012: Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott promises to appeal the court’s ruling that rejected the voter ID case. He conceded then, however, that nothing will happen before the November election because the ruling is tied to a lawsuit that also challenges Section 5 of the federal Voting Rights Act. Nov. 6, 2012: In the general election, Democrats gained seven seats in the Texas House but again failed to win a statewide race. State leadership, as well as Texas’ two U.S. Senate seats, are held by Republicans. Nov. 9, 2012: The U.S. Supreme Court decides to hear oral arguments in Shelby County v. Holder. Feb. 26, 2013: The high court hears oral arguments in the case. Shortly after deliberations begin, observers note that the landmark legislation appears in jeopardy. Reporter and analyst Lyle Denniston,reporting for SCOTUSblog, writes that Section 5’s fate could be left to Justice Anthony Kennedy. “If Kennedy believes that there is no way tojustify any longer that kind ofoversight of nine states that have to do the most to obey the 1965 law, that law may well be doomed,” he wrote. “But it also was Kennedy who left the impression that he might be willing to go along with a potential way to short-circuitthe case of Shelby County v. Holder, and allow the law to survive for some time more.” March 2013: A University of Tribune poll reflected that as time drew nearer to a decision, Texans' views on whether Section 5 was still an essential component of the Voting Rights Act had shifted. “We found that in the four intervening months, support for the substance of Section 5 had declined while opposition had increased,” pollster James Henson wrote, referring to the previous poll in October. “Overall support for the principle of pre-clearance fell from 51 percent to 44 percent, and opposition increased from 36 percent to 40 percent.” Henson credits the drop to a number of factors, including the re-election of Obama in November and an uptick in partisan back and forth leading as a decision drew nearer.

{"text": "Originally published on Grist. The world is changing under our feet. The atmosphere warms. The Arctic greens. Habitats collapse. We wouldn't have wished this on ourselves, but it's not all bad. Every change presents a new niche opening for an upstart species. Nature adapts. And when upstart species begin to thrive, you can be sure that the most opportunistic species of them all, Homo sapiens, will try to eat them. You can see this adaptation at the docks on Lake Erie where goldfish have quietly wriggled into the American diet. Yes, goldfish. Fishermen sold more than 100,0 pounds of them last year. Perhaps some kid wins one at the fair, brings it home in a plastic bag, and then sets it free in a creek. These goldfish have been fruitful, they have multiplied, and they have grown into monsters - well, actually they are just a couple pounds each, but that's still big enough to terrify me. Goldfish are now a mainstay of commercial fishing in the Great Lakes, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources told reporter Garret Ellison in a terrific MLive story. Many journey from the shores of Lake Erie to the Fulton Fish Market in New York, where buyers snap them up. It seems that \"golden carp\" already has a place on some American plates. They have also developed a following among some native predators: Back in 20, a naturalist witnessed an osprey carrying off a large goldfish from a marsh near Lake Tahoe. People have been excited about eating non-native species for a long time. The logic is understandable enough. If we don't want so many of these critters and they're edible, why not eat them? The lionfish, a native of the Indo-Pacific with venomous lances extending from its body, plies the warming waters around Long Island. New York restaurants, such as Norman's Cay in Manhattan, now serve lionfish fried whole, and they taste great. Asian carp and snakehead, other invasive fish, are moving up the Mississippi River, so people from Baltimore to Chicago are finding ways to cook them (reviews are mixed, but they've done well in a blind taste test.) And those are just the new kids. The common garden snail munching on your kale is the same one from Europe that you can buy slathered with butter and garlic as escargot. The pesky dandelion came to America on the Mayflower as a food and medicinal crop. When starlings spread across North America, people wrote up recipes for starling pie. Those older examples suggest that we probably aren't going to eat non-natives into oblivion. If a species is thriving in an ecological niche, it takes sustained effort to wipe it out. And there are just too many - about 50,0 if you count every exotic species we've introduced. We may not beat them back, but we can make use of them. That's what adaptation is all about. Despite the best efforts of activists to resist wholescale planetary change, it's already underway. Sometimes we can work to get the genie back in the bottle, but when that's impossible, we might as well have the genie over for dinner.

{"text": "Josh Marshall sums up the emerging GOP strategy for opppsing a Clinton Presidency on Talking Points Memo. I just heard what seems to be the closing argument from Donald Trump and his supporter Paul Ryan. In so many words, if Hillary Clinton wins, we’ll throw so many investigations her way that nothing will ever get done and it will be nonstop tension and drama. Back in March 2015 I wrote this post about what I called my quiet dreadat the prospect of another Clinton presidency. I have fond memories of the 90s but have no desire to live them again. As I wrote in that piece, the Clintons both have a codependent and toxic relationship with the national political press. Hillary is tight with information, creating suspicion which leads to bad news stories, investigations, on and on. The emails story is really the epitome of the ‘Clinton scandal’. At the end of the day, simply no there there. But why were we here in the first place? Why use a private server in your own home. Republicans spent the 90s practicing opposition by investigation. It was endless and exhausting. But both Clintons had a habit of giving them just enough to work with. Some readers have called me out for referring to ‘the Clintons.’ After all, Hillary Clinton is running for president, not Bill. I take the point. But they share a large number of longtime advisors, habits of dealing with what has often been mercilessly terrible press coverage and so forth. One encouraging sign I’ve seen of late is that Hillary made the decision to staff this campaign with a newer set of staffers who lacked a lot of those bad habits – the contrast with her 2008 campaign is really palpable. I hope she continues on that path in staffing an administration. This is actually the one thing I’ve learned from all those Podesta emails. A lot of the younger staffers see how a lot of the older staffers Clinton brings from the 90s create trouble for themselves with excessive secrecy. It’s not an easy pattern to break out of. As they say, even paranoids can have enemies. And a lot of the paranoia of Clinton and her longtime staffers is driven by the fact that they do have a lot of enemies. As I wrote in that post 18 months ago, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton were not blameless for all that 90s drama. Certainly, Bill wasn’t when it came to his personal indiscretions. But by and large, Republicans in the 90s realized they usually could not win on policy and made a conscious decision to practice opposition by scandal and investigation. This latest turn of the email case is really just another example of this. What Trump and Ryan are arguing now is little different from the Republican strategy of creating legislative gridlock and then running against governmental paralysis. It’s just pure gall and dishonesty. It would be funny if they weren’t in a position to put the country through it again. Cross-posted from The Sensible Center", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace tried to shame Hillary Clinton for not responding to interview requests. He suggested that she was too rude or too arrogant or cowardly to come on his show. But it’s quite possible that Wallace blew his chance when he infuriated Bill Clinton by trying to blame him for 9/11 during a now-famous 2006 interview. On Sunday, Wallace took time out to hit Hillary Clinton for not coming on the show. From the transcript: WALLACE: With Bernie Sanders’ appearance here last week, we’ve now sat down with every candidate in the race except Hillary Clinton. As we noted, she was asked recently what she would do as president to bring the country together. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLINTON: I think it’s an important point the president made in his State of the Union. And here’s what I would say. I will go anywhere to meet with anyone at any time to find common ground. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: But, once again this week, Clinton turned down our request for an interview. We reached out to her campaign officials in charge of this sort of thing, communications director Jennifer Palmieri, and press secretary Nick Merrill. Neither of them had the courtesy to even answer our phone calls and emails. But Hillary Clinton may well have had in mind that time that Wallace sandbagged Bill Clinton by violating the terms of their interview in order to suggest he had not done enough to capture Osama Bin Laden. As former NewsHound Judy wrote back then: Wallace stated in his introduction to the interview that the ground rules called for a 15-minute interview, with half the time devoted to Clinton’s global initiatives and half the time to anything Wallace wanted to ask. Then he innocently told the viewers “that’s not how it turned out.” Wallace did indeed ask a few questions about the global initiatives conference. Less than four minutes into the interview, however, Wallace shifted the questions to whether Clinton had done enough to try to capture Osama bin Laden. Four minutes is not half of 15 minutes by anybody’s watch. When Clinton called Wallace on that fact, Wallace dodged by saying most of the questions he had written down had to do with the global initiatives. Then, he returned to the global initiatives conference at the end of the interview, but only after Clinton had shamed him into it by telling the audience what the ground rules were. Would Wallace even have admitted he had agreed to allow Clinton seven and a half minutes to talk about global initiatives had Clinton not brought it up in the interview? Would Wallace have returned to the topic had Clinton not called him on his dishonesty? The videos below don't include Wallace's introduction but you can read Fox’s complete transcript here. The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple points out other good reasons Hillary Clinton might think she wouldn’t get a fair shake on Fox. The top three come from Andrea Tantaros, the cohost who asked her radio show listeners to “do me a favor” and punch an Obama supporter “in the face.” One can only imagine what she might ask people to do to a Hillary Clinton supporter. Speaking of courtesy, it’s safe to say that Fox News’s Andrea Tantaros didn’t exhibit too much when she said the following about Clinton on the the noon show “Outnumbered”: “People are making the comparison that she’s a thoroughbred horse who can’t get over the line. She’s on her way to the glue factory in a real way. It’s true. It’s true,” said Tantaros. Call that Possible Reason No. 1 that the Clinton camp isn’t returning the messages of “Fox News Sunday.” For Possible Reason No. 2, let’s go to “Outnumbered” co-host Andrea Tantaros, who last year referred to Clinton as the “ most corrupt woman in the history of the world.” For Possible Reason No. 3, why not try “Outnumbered” co-host Andrea Tantaros? Referencing the Michael Bay-directed film “13 Hours” about the Benghazi attacks of Sept. 11, 2012, she said, “If anyone sees this movie, and everyone should go see it, and goes on to vote for Hillary Clinton they’re a criminal, in my estimation.” Those are just a few of the many, many smears and jeers that are made against the Clintons on Fox News. TVNewser reported Monday, “Clinton’s traveling press secretary Nick Merrill responded to the show today. The spokesperson adds, ‘we look forward to having a conversation’ about a potential Hillary Clinton booking on Fox News Sunday.” Watch Bill Clinton nail Wallace on his bias, below, from the November 24, 2006 Fox News Sunday, via our friend Eyes on Fox.", "label": "true"}
{"text": "What \"counts\" as an act of terrorism? It's a question that is both easy and impossible to answer, and one that many Americans are now debating with regards to the mass murder in Charleston, South Carolina. That this question has grown so urgent should tell you there is much more at stake here than a matter of terminology. Defining this as terrorism is a way of asking that Americans recognize the severity of the effect and intent of this attack, and that we take this as seriously as we would other forms of terrorism. It asks that we see this as part of a long and painful history of politically motivated white violence against black communities. It's also a way of calling attention to the fact that Americans are willing, even eager, to use the word \"terrorist\" for some kinds of people, but not for others. It demands us to ask why that is, and what it says about our attitudes toward race and violence. It is often the case in America that when we talk about issues related to race, we are really talking about something else, something that is too big and painful to speak to directly. This is one of those moments. Often, people start this debate by asking whether the definition of terrorism applies here, and that requires knowing the definition — of which, of course, there is none. The US legal system has taken a few goes at this question. A law on international terrorism, later expanded to domestic terrorism by the Patriot Act, characterized it as criminal violence with the intent to \"intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence the policy of a government, or affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.\" Political scientists have tried to define it as well, but are hugely divided over this question, which is as controversial within the academy as it is outside of it. The Irish political scientist Louise Richardson, in her book on the subject, ventured a seven-point definition that boiled down to, in her words, \"Terrorism simply means deliberately and violently targeting civilians for political purposes.\" Even that does not fully capture what we mean when we say \"terrorism,\" in part because the word has taken on a cultural weight in the US that goes beyond formal definitions. This debate does not have such emotional force, after all, because everyone is highly engaged with litigating the relevant political science literature. Rather, it is because whether or not we call this \"terrorism\" has tremendous implications for the narrative we construct around this attack, and thus around issues of race and violence in America. Today in this country, when we call something \"terrorism\" we are making a moral judgment about the odious wrongness of the perpetrator but also about the right of the targeted group to feel that they are under threat and thus to be protected. That makes the debate over whether white supremacist violence against African Americans counts as \"terrorism\" both a very important one and a very uncomfortable one. It requires us to acknowledge our history of politically motivated white violence against black communities, and to admit that this history is not fully over. It forces us to acknowledge that black communities are both reasonably afraid of this violence and rightly entitled to protection from it. When you understand that, the debate over whether to call it terrorism begins to make a lot more sense. It is a question of whether we ultimately characterize this attack as something that occurred in isolation — a \"confused loner driven by mental instability\" — or as part of a larger movement or trend of political violence. It is a question of whether we define the victims very narrowly, as just the people who were in that church, or define them more broadly, as a larger population that the attacker intended to terrorize. The attacks of 9/11, for example, physically targeted only certain structures in Washington and New York, but were clearly intended to terrorize all Americans. And that was how it was experienced. From what has been so far reported of the Charleston shooter, it appears at least possible that he intended to terrorize all black Americans. Just as important, perhaps, is how the attack is experienced by black communities. And that experience, shaded as it is by so many recent stories of police violence, appears to be one of a community that feels terrorized beyond just one shooting in South Carolina. A man holds up a sign after a vigil outside Morris Brown AME Church. (BRENDAN /Getty) Labeling this an act of terrorism implies that it is intended to terrorize all African Americans — or, more importantly, that it may justifiably be experienced that way. By extension, this acknowledges that there is indeed a discrete and ongoing trend or movement in this country of political violence committed by white people against African Americans. When we ask whether the Charleston killer is a terrorist, we are really asking whether such a trend of politically motivated white-on-black violence still exists. That is an intensely controversial question in this country. It touches on sensitive, raw issues of racial inequality, which extends to everything from criminal justice to college admissions. It is not easy to talk about. So we end up talking about narrower manifestations of this instead, such as whether the shooter in Charleston counts as a terrorist. The Ku Klux Klan is no longer a major force in America, of course; the era of cross burnings is over. But there has been one story after another of predominantly white police forces deploying excessive force against black communities, which to many people feels like an extension of a long-running trend in this country. The outrage over South Carolina continuing to fly the Confederate flag at full mast on the grounds of its statehouse is instructive here. For some, the flag is irrelevant to this shooting. For others, it could hardly be more relevant, as the flag symbolizes a history of white political violence against black Americans. Arguments that the shooter was no terrorist at all, but rather a mere criminal, end up speaking to more than just the definition of terrorism. It can be a way of denying that larger narrative of politically motivated violence, and a way of telling African Americans they are wrong to see this shooting as connected to that larger history, if such a history really exists at all. This is why the media's hesitation to label the shooting as terrorism is, understandably and rightly, causing such offense. To paraphrase Edward Said, the Palestinian-American theorist of Orientalism, it is in some senses a question of which groups of people are and are not granted permission to narrate their own stories. If black Americans say they experience this attack as part of a trend of white terrorism against black communities, and the media says the attack was not really terrorism, that does not just ignore the experiences of black Americans, it denies them permission even to tell their own stories. Many of those calling for the Charleston shooting to be identified as terrorism have pointed out, correctly, that the shooter was white, and here in America we have a bad habit of not wanting to see white, non-Muslim terrorists as terrorists. That includes, for example, the man who attacked the Holocaust Museum in Washington in 2009, killing a guard. Or the man who flew his plane into an IRS building in Austin in 2010, killing himself and another person. Rather, only \"other\" kinds of people can be terrorists, and then that terrorism is said to be somewhere rooted in \"their culture\" and its \"problems.\" And we don't want to acknowledge that maybe our culture can have problems as well. As Micah Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote last year, \"We treat 'terrorism' in the common vernacular differently because it is ascribed to foreigners who are unlike us, whereas similarly savage behavior conducted by fellow Americans is a reflection of us.\" To label what happened in Charleston an act of terrorism would compel us to look inward. We as a society may not feel ready for that. But if we are to respond appropriately to this violence, and prevent it from happening again, look inward we must. We owe the victims that much.", "label": "true"}

{"text": "Ted Glick is on the 44th day of his fast, by my count, as part of his effort to bring awareness to and demand action concerning global warming. On Sunday through Tuesday, October 21 to 23, there will be a series of protests and actions grouped under the name “ No war, no warming.” It is an attempt to bridge the two issues of ending the war in Iraq and global warming by taking immediate action to: Stop the war in Iraq and future resource wars by ending our addiction to fossil fuels; Shift government funding to rebuild New Orleans and all communities suffering from racism and corporate greed; Go green and promote environmental justice with new jobs in a clean energy economy. In my last post, I argued that it is important for environmental activists to build coalitions with others that are working for progressive change, for instance among European-Americans and African-Americans. In this post, I want to discuss the meaning of peace, war, and the military, and how integrating these issues might help in the fight to save the biosphere — and how people might understandably feel that such issues might hurt such efforts as well. In this era of an alleged “war on terror” (really more of a police investigation of terror), people are skittish about criticizing the military. Taking on the military might seem futile, might seem to alienate a large constituency of people open to action on global warming. While I don’t hope to change that perspective with this post, I want to at least offer a few ideas to think about. First of all, the long-term military capability of the U.S. is dependent on our ability to produce the machinery that is used by sustainable energy, transportation, and agricultural sectors of the economy. The reason: the military depends on a healthy manufacturing sector in order to produce its tanks, jets, and ships. Throughout human history, powerful countries keep repeating the same process: They build up their economies because of technological innovations, and then they take the great wealth produced by the expanding economy and squander most of it on the pursuit of empire. The UK invented the industrial revolution, created the world’s largest empire, and is now a virtual economic colony. The Soviet Union built up its economy to the point where the launch of the Sputnik satellite 50 years ago terrified the U.S. into building up its science education system; then the USSR collapsed by turning the entire country into a military-industrial complex. And the United States? It dominated the 20th century in manufacturing, particularly machinery, building up an economy that its biggest corporations are now busy disassembling, while the military budget and wars are bankrupting the country. Pretty soon, the U.S. Air Force will be flying jets from Volvo and the Army will be driving tanks from Daimler Benz, with a force full of mercenaries. Machiavelli of The Prince fame warned the Italians to avoid this fate in the 1500s, so this behavior is nothing new. The Italians wound up being conquered for a few centuries; Americans’ standard of living will shrink if this process continues, as I will explain in my next post, but the American military empire will certainly collapse along with the manufacturing sector. Now, I’m not advocating maintaining an empire. In fact, the irony of military power is this: the less you build it up, the better it will be when you need it. That’s the lesson of World War II, when the U.S. had a smaller army than Bulgaria at the start of that conflict, but left the war with the biggest military system in history. America’s huge, world-class manufacturing base could be converted to emergency military use. So what we need is an economy that is humming on all cylinders, aggressively pursuing clean energy technologies, rail technologies, organic agriculture technologies. Can you imagine how the U.S. could turn from being an $800-billion-per-year net importer to a net exporter by leading the world in solar photovoltaics, solar thermal systems, wind, and geothermal heat exchange? And what if the U.S. had the world’s fastest trains, not Japanese or the French? This, then, might be a goal to build a coalition around: to turn the U.S. from empire building to renewable-energy and train building; from military innovation to clean energy innovation; from invading other countries in order to grab what’s left of the world’s oil, to working with other countries to build sustainable economies throughout the world. We can turn from encouraging global warring to preventing global warming.", "label": "false"}

The ad, which featured a menacing mug shot of Horton, helped Republican George H.W. Bush win the White House by portraying Dukakis as soft on crime.

{"text": "Growing up in the post-war era (after the Second World War), I never expected to live in the strange Kafkaesque world that exists today. The US government can assassinate any US citizen that the executive branch thinks could possibly be a “threat” to the US government, or throw the hapless citizen into a dungeon for the rest of his or her life without presenting any evidence to a court or obtaining a conviction of any crime, or send the “threat” to a puppet foreign state to be tortured until the “threat” confesses to a crime that never occurred or dies at the hands of “freedom and democracy” while professing innocence. It has never been revealed how a single citizen, or any number thereof, could possibly comprise a threat to a government that has a trillion plus dollars to spend each year on security and weapons, the world’s largest navy and air force, 700-plus military bases across the world, large numbers of nuclear weapons, 16 intelligence agencies plus the intelligence agencies of its NATO puppet states and the intelligence service of Israel. Nevertheless, air travelers are subjected to porno-scanning and sexual groping. Cars traveling on Interstate highways can expect to be stopped, with traffic backed up for miles, while Homeland Security and the federalized state or local police conduct searches. I witnessed one such warrantless search on Easter Sunday. The southbound lanes of I-185 heading into Columbus, Georgia, were at a standstill while black SUV and police car lights flashed. US citizens were treated by “security” forces that they finance as if they were “terrorists” or “domestic extremists,” another undefined class of Americans devoid of constitutional protections. These events are Kafkaesque in themselves, but they are ever more so when one considers that these extraordinary violations of the US Constitution fail to be overturned in the Supreme Court. Apparently, American citizens lack standing to defend their civil liberties. Yet, ObamaCare is before the US Supreme Court. The conservative majority might now utilize the “judicial activism” for which conservatives have criticized liberals. Hypocrisy should no longer surprise us. However, the fight over ObamaCare is not worth five cents. It is extraordinary that “liberals,” “progressives,” “Democrats,” whatever they are, are defending a “health program” that uses public monies to pay private insurance companies and that raises the cost of health care. Americans have been brainwashed that “a single-payer system is unaffordable” because it is “socialized medicine.” Despite this propaganda, accepted by many Americans, European countries manage to afford single-payer systems. Health care is not a stress, a trauma, an unaffordable expense for European populations. Among the Western Civilized Nations, only the richest, the US, has no universal health care. The American health care system is the most expensive of all on earth. The reason for the extraordinary expense is the multiple of entities that must make profits. The private doctors must make profits. The private testing centers must make profits. The private specialists who receive the referrals from general practitioners must make profits. The private hospitals must make profits. The private insurance companies must make profits. The profits are a huge cost of health care. On top of these profits come the costs of preventing and combating fraud. Because private insurance companies resist paying and Medicare pays a small fraction of the medical charges, private health care providers charge as much as they possibly can, knowing that the payments will be cut to the bone. But a billing mistake of even $300 can bankrupt a health care provider from legal expenses defending self from fraud accusations. The beauty of a single-payer system is that it takes the profits out of the system. No one has to make profits. Wall Street cannot threaten insurance companies and private health care companies with being taken over because their profits are too low. No health-provider in a single-payer system has to worry about being displaced in a takeover organized by Wall Street because the profits are too low. Because a single-payer system eliminates the profits that drive up the costs, Wall Street, insurance companies, and “free market economists” hate a “socialized” medical care system. They prefer a socialized “private” health care system in which public monies flow into private insurance companies. To make the costs as high as possible, conservatives and the private insurance companies devised ObamaCare. The bill was written by conservative think tanks and the private insurance companies. What the “socialistic” ObamaCare bill does is to take income taxes paid by citizens and use the taxes to subsidize the private medical premiums charges by private health care providers in order to provide “private” health care to US citizens who cannot afford it. The extremely high costs of ObamaCare is not “socialistic medicine.” ObamaCare is high-cost privatized medicine that guarantees billions of dollars in profits to private insurance companies. It remains to be seen whether such a ridiculous health care scheme, nowhere extant on earth except in Romney’s Massachusetts, will provide health care or just private profits.

{"text": "Hubris is reason for U.S. foreign policy failures By Shoshana Bryen WASHINGTON, D.C. — It is tempting to simply list all the ways the Obama administration — particularly Secretaries Kerry and Hagel — has been wrong on foreign and defense policy. After all, , Syria, Iran, China, and are nothing to sneeze at. But finding a common thread among the mistakes might be the beginning of a corrective policy — if not by this administration, then perhaps by Congress or the next administration. The common thread is hubris, the supreme confidence that what you think is what everyone thinks — they’re just waiting for you to show up. Hubris is the natural state of affairs in the faculty lounges of major universities and, most likely, in the “World’s Greatest Deliberative Body,” in which the president, Hagel, Biden, Clinton, and Kerry all served. A subdivision of hubris is the conceit that words equal action; that what is said is what is done. It is a subdivision because if you think there is no political or economic or social disagreement, then everyone must just be waiting for you to perorate. Secretary of State Kerry called Vladimir Putin’s restoration of Crimea to the status of Russian territory, “19th Century thinking in the 21st century,” while Putin pocketed Crimea and considers cutting off the gas flow through Ukraine to Europe. He is, apparently, unoffended by a reference to the Tsars he considers Russian patriots. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel tried empathy, authorizing release of the details of U.S. cyber warfare doctrine to China in a bid to win similar cooperation from Beijing. So far, China has not reciprocated. Bill Gertz wrote in The Washington Times, “Instead of pressing the Chinese to curb cyberattacks, the defense secretary said the Pentagon has sought to ‘be more open about our cyber capabilities, including our approach of restraint’…for the first time ever, the Pentagon provided Chinese officials with a briefing on U.S. doctrine on cyber capabilities. Lt. Col. Damien Pickart said, ‘The purpose of this briefing was to increase transparency of one another’s military cyber activities and intentions.’” Transparency appears to have been the policy of only one side. Empathy didn’t work with Iran, either. At the UN General Assembly last year, President Obama ascribed motives and goals to the Iranian regime that mirror American motives and goals, assuaged what he said were their concerns, and promised what he thought was a better future. “I do believe that if we can resolve the issue of Iran’s nuclear program, that can serve as a major step down a long road toward a different relationship based on mutual interests and mutual respect.” But if Iran doesn’t believe we have “mutual interests” and instead seeks a future in which the Islamic Republic is the hegemonic Gulf power and the United States is banished, the nuclear program is not an “issue” to be “resolved,” but a means toward a considered end — an Iranian end. Secretary Kerry claimed the P5+1 deal signed in November with Iran would provide greater transparency and a longer breakout time from nuclear capability to nuclear weapons. He crowed on Politico‘s “State of the Union” program, “I believe that from this day, Israel is safer. We are going to expand the amount of time in which (Iran) can break out… have insights to their program that we didn’t have before. Israel, if you didn’t have these things, would be seeing Iran to continue on a daily basis to narrow the breakdown (sic) time.” He also said sanctions on Iran would be lifted only by a “tiny portion,” which would be “very limited, temporary and reversible… So believe me, when I say this relief is limited and reversible, I mean it.” Just words. Since then the Iranians have announced their defense capabilities will not be subject to negotiation (including the Parchin Plant that the West believes is nuclear weapons related) and that Iran will never give up its nuclear program. In addition, Kerry told a Senate hearing this week that Iran now has the ability to produce fissile material for a nuclear bomb in two months.”I think it’s public knowledge today that we’re operating with a time period for a so-called ‘break-out’ of about two months. That’s been in the public domain.” And as for sanctions, our allies are cashing in on the newly opened Iranian gravy train — including still-embargoed dual-use technology — and American companies are doing the same. The Treasury Department gave Boeing and GE permission to sell aircraft parts to the Islamic Republic to service 18 planes sold before the Revolution. That may not sound impressive, but it bears noting that the first part of the Syrian sanctions lifted by President Obama in 2009 included aircraft parts. By the time the sanctions were reinstated in 2010, Assad’s planes were flying. “Barrel bombs” were the result. This raises the whole, “Assad is a reformer,” conversation, promoted by Secretary of State Clinton when Kerry was still a senator. The assumption was that Assad wanted the benefits of association with the West more than he wanted to crush dissent. When she determined that her words had no impact on Assad, Mrs. Clinton turned them on the Syrian people, “When are they going to start pulling the props out from under this illegitimate regime?” Nearly 200,0 dead, use of chemical weapons, and 2 million refugees later, the U.S. still has no Syria policy beyond words. Manuel Roig-Franzia used a lot of words in a panegyric to Samantha Power in The Washington Post. “Power, 43, is saddled with unusually high expectations… In one of her early acts after becoming ambassador in August, she delivered a high-profile speech arguing for limited airstrikes in Syria. The strikes never happened… ‘I’m sure for some who counted on me to end the war in Syria within my first semester here,” she says one afternoon at her office, pausing to chuckle, “I’m sure I’ve disappointed.’” The chuckle, and a self-reference as the “genocide chick” aren’t funny, but they make clear the difference between the talk-is-action world of universities and think tanks, and the real world in which people die, even after convening a “Genocide Prevention Board.” And finally, the Palestinians. The administration assumed that Palestinian goal was an independent country. Palestinian objections to the permanence and legitimacy of Israel, to Israel controlling Jerusalem and to giving up the so-called “right of return” could be overcome with money and political favors. Imagine how surprised Secretary Kerry and President Obama were when Mahmoud Abbas came to Washington and told the President “no” three times while seated in the Oval Office. Try as he might to leave the impression that Israel scuttled the talks, it is clear that Kerry was so taken with the importance of his plan for Middle East peace that he never entertained the possibility that one of his interlocutors had different goals. That is the definition of hubris, and explains not only how wrong the administration has been, but also why. Shoshana Bryen is senior policy director of the Jewish Policy Center.

{"text": "I have to confess, this is completely new to me. But the online-only currency currently going through a massive boom looks extremely interesting, and could pave the way for a completely new economy. Here's a great vid briefly explaining how it works ( the Dish): And as you can see, the currency doesn't look to be slowing down: Here's Felix Salmon on the downside: If millions of people started using bitcoins on a regular basis, the soaring value of bitcoins would actually be disastrous. You’ve heard of hyperinflation: this would be hyperdeflation. Take a gold bar valued at $600,0. At $60 per bitcoin, the value of that bar is 10,0 BTC. But then assume that bitcoins rise in value to $600 apiece, and then to $6,0, and then to $60,0 — as would have to happen if the fixed number of bitcoins was being used to store hundreds of billions of dollars in value. Then the value of the gold bar would plunge, in bitcoin terms — to 1,0 BTC and then 100 BTC and finally just 10 BTC. The same thing would happen to all other goods and services in the world, including your own salary.Everythingwould be constantly going down in price, if you thought in bitcoin terms. And an interesting piece in Business Insider on why the explosive growth could continue, and why the potential upside makes it so worthwhile : You may think there is no conceivable way that Bitcoin prices could ever hit $2,350. And you might be right. But ask yourself this question: When Bitcoins were trading for $35 six weeks ago, did you think there was a chance that they would ever hit $235? If you're like most people, you didn't. If you're like most people, you either had no idea what Bitcoins even were . or you cackled smugly about how Bitcoin was obviously a bubble and that all of the idiots stupid enough to buy Bitcoin would lose their shirts. Well, just so you know, many of those \"idiots\" were laughing at you, too. One of them reached out to me the other day. He explained why he bought a boatload of Bitcoins when they were trading for much less than $35 apiece: . over the long term the only two possible outcomes are 1000X+ or 0 — I don't know the probability of each possible outcome, but I firmly believe those are the only two possible options . I actually don't think $400 is a meaningful equilibrium point for it.", "label": "true"}

{"text": "Samantha Bee accused states of auditioning for Hoarders: Rape Kit Edition on Monday, with a scorching Full Frontal segment on the 400,0 rape kits that are sitting untested in police evidence rooms across the country. Most rapists are serial offenders, Bee pointed out, not \"college boys who were confused about consent that one time\" — and testing rape kits can connect the dots between cold cases and bring those offenders to justice. Yet not only are thousands of kits sitting around collecting dust, but some departments are actually destroying untested kits, even for unresolved cases before the statute of limitations runs up. Destroying rape kits like this is legal in every state, Bee pointed out. Thankfully, a growing number of states are passing bipartisan legislation to clear the rape kit backlog — but some local officials are standing in the way, like Georgia State Sen. Renee Unterman. The Georgia House unanimously passed the Pursuing Justice for Rape Victims Act, which would require timely processing of rape kits and seek to end the backlog by requiring the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to issue an annual report on how many kits are still waiting to be tested. But Unterman was on the state Senate committee that blocked the bill. \"If there was a problem . I would have written the legislation,\" Unterman said in a news interview clip. \"Woman, have you lost your fucking mind?\" Bee yelled. \"Are you just pissed that someone else wrote the law instead of you? Or are you in the pocket of Big Rape? I don't know!\" Unterman added in another news clip that the state has already received a $2 million grant, which means the issue is being resolved, and that there's no reason to write a law \"just because it makes you feel good.\" Bee pointed out that the grant money will run out \"long before Georgia runs out of rapists.\" But at least Unterman \"believes rape exists,\" Bee said, unlike Idaho Sheriff Craig Rowland. Rowland told local news that after interviewing alleged rape victims, police often find it wasn't actually rape — rather, \"things went too far, and someone got scared.\" \"Things went too far, and someone got scared? That's what rape is!\" Bee said. After Rowland said the \"majority\" of alleged rapes were consensual sex, Bee let him have it. \"Listen, you giant pink hamster-fetus of a man . you can believe women are lying whores all you want off the clock, but when you're the sheriff, you have to listen to rape victims,\" she said. \"Otherwise, when the women in your county rise up and strangle you with your own stupid monogrammed shirt, it's going to be assisted suicide, because you're definitely asking for it.\" Vox's Dara Lind explains that, unfortunately, a lot of police officers hold the same views as Rowland. There's a vicious cycle in law enforcement of believing that most rape victims lie, which makes police more suspicious of victims' stories, which leads them to take fewer stories seriously and spend less time investigating them. But a new independent body of research finds that only about 2 to 8 percent of rape reports are false, and police are slowly getting more educated about the real signs of a false report. Bee concluded by pointing out that both Unterman and Rowland are running unopposed in the upcoming November elections.", "label": "true"}
{"text": "After the demise of El Niño, the climate phenomenon that has helped fuel record-setting heat for the past two years, all eyes have stayed on the Pacific waiting for its counterpart, La Niña. Without the cooling influence of a La Niña event, the planet is likely to continue feeling the heat for the rest of the year. July and August tied for the hottest month ever recorded and 2016 is essentially guaranteed to be the hottest year on record. So now after a few months of waiting for the arrival of La Niña, where do we stand? Well, that depends on who you ask. According to the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA), La Niña has in fact arrived. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, another of the big tropical Pacific watchers, has a La Niña watch in place, but is still waiting for its “official” arrival. But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dropped its La Niña watch last week, indicating that it’s unlikely that a La Niña will form this fall or winter. All three agencies are looking at the same ocean, but have come to different conclusions about when — or even if — La Niña is going to happen. The main reason comes down to how you define La Niña. For the average person, it just means cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures. But scientists are a little more precise than that. Let’s start with NOAA and why they’re feeling bearish on La Niña. “We dropped our watch mainly because of the lack of model support for an extended duration of La Niña conditions that we need to see,” Michelle L’Heureux, a scientist at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said. For NOAA to officially declare a La Niña, ocean temperatures in a specific region of the tropical Pacific (dubbed NINO3.4 for the hardcore nerds out there) need to be 0.9 degrees F (0.5 degrees C) below normal for five running three-month averages in a row (so September-November, October-December, and so on). While it’s cooler than normal in that region right now (right on the edge of the La Niña threshold in fact), the models NOAA uses to look at the coming seasons just aren’t feeling the chill. Something similar happened after the super El Niño of 1982-83, so there is precedent, according to L’Heureux. She also stressed that it doesn’t mean NOAA has written off La Niña, but the odds of it are just less likely now. The Bureau of Meteorology has even more stringent temperature guidelines for La Niña. Temperatures in the same region of the tropical Pacific need to be 1.55 degrees F (0.8 degrees C) below normal, though the bureau doesn’t have the running average requirement. It also uses a variety of models, similar to NOAA, but it weighs them differently. Its outlook still hints more strongly at a La Niña, hence the watch remains. Then there’s JMA. It looks at another region of the Pacific (NINO3 for the nerds), where temperatures have been cool enough to declare a weak La Niña. There’s also a question of models. “The Japanese currently weight their JMA model heavily, and it maintains a weak La Niña through mid-winter,” Tony Barnston, an El Niño (and La Niña) expert at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, said. This is to say nothing of the atmospheric side of La Niña, which each agency also views differently. L’Heureux also said that other meteorological agencies around the world have even more varied views on what defines La Niña. In Peru, for example, they monitor an area of the Pacific closer to the Peruvian coast because temperatures can drive impacts over the region, according to L’Heureux. This might have shades of 2014 when El Niño kinda, sorta maybe arrived in September that year and lingered into 2015 before blowing up into one of the strongest El Niños on record last winter. If there’s one thing the three agencies agree on, however, it’s that this La Niña is unlikely to follow a similar pattern. In the absence of La Niña, the entire U.S. is likely to endure an extended stretch of warm weather for the next three months. In comparison, La Niña usually creates cool conditions in parts of the U.S., notably the Northwest. On a planetary scale, the heat is likely to march on too, though it’s unlikely to maintain its recent record-setting clip through the fall and winter. Some scientists have predicted a slight respite from the planetary heat in 2017 even without the influence of La Niña. Given that the world is hanging out right at the edge of the 1.5 degrees C threshold, that’s a small consolation, though.", "label": "false"}
{"text": "The Occupy movement continues to spring up across America, and the authorities are taking notice. The attack on protesters in Oakland by a large and heavily-armed police force received particular attention, with one protester struck in the head and severely injured by a police projectile. Video footage shows the protester, Scott Olsen, standing still as projectiles were fired. Then, while Olsen lay on the ground bleeding, a cop threw a stun grenade into a group of protesters who came to his aid. Police forcibly removed occupiers in San Diego and Rochester and clamped down on those in frigid Denver. And at Occupy Wall Street’s Liberty Park, an electric generator was taken and literature uncovered in the rain during the latest underhanded actions by authorities. What we see in the clouds of teargas and the handcuffed crowds is the state doing its thing. The state is made of authoritarian power relations backed by force. The politicians who decide how to direct state force are influenced by people with power. They are often themselves elites before taking office, and they do what they can for those who help keep them in power. They act in the interest of “stability”: Not the stability of the average person, but the stability of the system. Their priority is not for average people to live comfortably in the knowledge that they are on solid ground so long as they work reasonably and help each other. Their priority is to secure the wealth machinery that fuels political power. But the state’s power comes not only from force but from enough people accepting its exercise of force — believing it is legitimate or believing that they are helpless to stop it. The state is more than a set of power relations; it’s also the people who make those relations function. And people have the power to decide. This was made clear in Albany, as police resisted calls from politicians to disperse the crowd and instead acted in the interest of public safety. And Arun Gupta notes that police in Allentown, PA were openly supportive of the local Occupation. Each of the police officers who attacked protesters in Oakland could have said no. Like Bradley Manning, they could have refused complicity in wrongdoing and joined in resisting it. Like Iraq War veteran Scott Olsen did when he became active in anti-war organizations, they can stop doing harm and start healing the harms they’ve dealt. Unfortunately, the political, social, and economic incentives to obey orders are difficult to overcome. If the people giving the orders are seen as “us” and the protesters seen as “them,” it is less likely for ethical questions to get their due consideration. But in revolutionary times, unexpected things can happen. A mobilized and conscious populace can deliver massive shocks to power relations, dispersing the power of elites among the people and opening opportunities to create a more just world of liberty and prosperity.", "label": "true"}
{"text": "Caption Close 2005-10-30 04:00:00 PDT Washington -- In an incestuous town renowned for grinding up outsiders, few will forget a boyish-looking prosecutor from Chicago staring down two of the city's most venerable institutions. Circumstance, evidence and lawyers will determine what role the prosecution of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby will play in history. The damage has already cost the vice president his chief of staff and humbled the nation's most esteemed newspaper. As Patrick Fitzgerald, the 44-year-old federal prosecutor, stood before a bank of cameras Friday to announce the conclusion of his 22-month investigation, he made it plain that no institution, not the White House, not the New York Times, not any of the revered establishments that in fact or fancy run this town, would stand in the way of his dogged pursuit of justice. \"The truth is the engine of our judicial system, and if you compromise the truth, the whole process is lost,\" Fitzgerald said. For a moment, it was as if all the partisan trickery, the spin, the half-truths, the exercises of privilege, and journalistic shortcuts so taken for granted in Washington had been suspended. Fitzgerald took what appeared to many to be another inside-the-beltway tempest, and turned it into a very public illustration of how the law is bound by no political allegiance and how justice trumps even the most well-established Washington games. \"He tried to slay a lot of dragons at one time,\" said Bill Whalen, a fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution and a former speechwriter to Gov. Pete Wilson. \"He's this generation's Elliot Ness,\" Whalen said, referring to the famed federal agent who went after Al Capone's 1920's Chicago mob. \"He goes into this jaded, immoral town, and tries to be morally accountable.\" It is a rare day, particularly in the nation's capitol, when developments of any sort are not ascribed to partisan politics. In his quest to figure out whether crimes had been committed in the leaking of CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity, Fitzgerald showed no timidness, even as he bumped into the institutions revered by the left and right. When one of the most prominent reporters from the nation's most prominent newspaper claimed journalistic privilege and refused to cooperate, he had her jailed. When he was not satisfied with the testimony of the president's top aide, he brought him back to the grand jury four times. When the top aide to the vice president provided information he deemed dishonest, he charged him with five felonies. And when reporters demanded Friday that Fitzgerald engage in the age-old journalism game of trying to speculate on the bigger, underlying story -- in this case the war in Iraq and the role of other administration officials -- he flat out refused. \"This indictment is not about the war,\" Fitzgerald said. \"This is simply an indictment that says. whether some person, Mr. Libby, lied or not.\" Earlier accusations that Fitzgerald was on a witch hunt against Republicans, or doing the administration's bidding against the news media, seemed petty in the face of his resolve. \"One day I read that I was a Republican hack, and another day I read I was a Democratic hack. And the only thing I did between those two nights was sleep,\" he said in response to one query. The White House must now defend itself against charges leveled by a steel-nerved prosecutor who seems to fit the mantle of \"Washington outsider\" far better than the politicians who frequently claim it. When one reporter tried out the Republican Party's talking points, that the charges are less significant because they are not germane to the original accusation of leaking classified information, Fitzgerald shot back: \"Those talking points won't fly. If it's proven that the chief of staff of the vice president went before a federal grand jury and lied under oath repeatedly, and fabricated a story about how he learned this information, how he passed it on . that is a very serious matter.\" The New York Times also finds itself reeling after information contained in Fitzgerald's indictment about Libby's conversation's with reporter Judith Miller, and articles printed by the newspaper over the past two weeks, revealed an embarrassingly cozy relationship between Cheney's top aide and one of the Time's top reporters. At one point, when talking to Miller about former ambassador Joseph Wilson's trip to Africa to investigate claims that Saddam Hussein was trying to obtain nuclear material from Niger, Libby requested that she quote him as a \"former Hill staffer,\" to conceal his identity, something she said she agreed to because of his experience on Capitol Hill years ago. More broadly, Fitzgerald seemed to throw a gauntlet down to journalists who take for granted the confidentiality of their conversations with sources, and who are often thought to be just as arrogant as the high-ranking officials they cover. \"No one wanted to have a dispute with the New York Times or anyone else,\" Fitzgerald said. \"I was not looking for a First Amendment showdown. . My job was to find out what happened here, make reasoned judgments about what testimony was necessary, and then pursue it. \"I understand why it is that newspapers want sources, and I read newspapers, and I'm glad you have sources -- this is different,\" he told a room packed with reporters. \"This was situation where the conversation between the officials and the reporter may have been a crime itself.\" The evenhandedness of Fitzgerald's performance was evident by the absence of withering attacks from either side that are commonplace after such high-stakes appearances. Even the conservative editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, in trivializing the seriousness of Libby's transgressions, wrote Saturday that Fitzgerald's was \"dogged in pursuing his investigation, and he gave every appearance of being a reasonable and tough prosecutor in laying out the charges.\" Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at George Washington University who has been in Washington since he served in Eisenhower administration in the 1950s, said Fitzgerald \"is really the first of the special prosecutors that left the sense that he was nonpartisan, and that is something that I found, and people find, very attractive.\" As impressive as Fitzgerald was, Whalen said he doubts the prosecution will change Washington's ways. Fitzgerald said this wasn't about Iraq, but that won't stop Democrats from saying just that. He wouldn't speculate on who else might have been involved, but the news media will. And though Libby is accused of allegedly lying to investigators about leaking disparaging information about an opponent, Whalen said the practice will be rampant in the next political campaign. \"Is this going to change the culture of Washington one iota? I don't think so,\" Whalen said. But Fitzgerald was clear that his goal was not about changing the culture; it was limited to pursing the law, no matter who stood in his way. \"Any notion anyone might have that there's a different standard for a high official . that this is somehow singling out obstruction of justice or perjury, is upside-down,\" he said, asserting he would make the same charges if the target of the investigation had been a truck driver. \"I think what we see here today, when a vice president's chief of staff is charged with perjury and obstruction of justice, it does show the world that this is a country that takes its law seriously, that all citizens are bound by the law.\"", "label": "false"}

{"text": "President Trump's White House invited mostly white children to the Easter Egg Roll event. Racially-diverse area school districts that were invited last year, including D.C. Public Schools, Arlington Public Schools and Alexandria City Public Schools, were not invited. It's unclear which districts and schools were invited, and whether some chose not to attend. On 18 April 2017, the liberal blog Occupy Democrats reported that the majority of children that attended that the annual White House Easter Egg Roll held for the first time under President Donald Trump were white: Yesterday, the White House’s held the annual Easter Egg Roll and while Trump’s gaffes inevitably took the spotlight away from the focus of the event – the children – and placed it back on our attention-obsessed narcissist-in-chief, it wasn’t long before it was noticed that an important tradition had been abandoned. After the event had concluded, shrewd observers noticed something very disturbing but was perhaps to be expected from the #AmericaFirst White Supremacy House. The attendees were almost overwhelmingly white children. The reason? Donald and Melania chose not to invite the local DC public school children that traditionally are invited to the White House Easter Roll. During an 11 April 2017 press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that tickets to the event had been“sent out to all the schools in the area.” That was not the case. Representatives for all three immediately-surrounding public school districts, D.C., Arlington and Alexandria, all told us they did not receive tickets to the event this year, unlike in previous years. According to the New York Times, these districts have in the past received tickets for as many as 4,0 children to attend the event. Some observers noted that in photographs from the event, the children in attendance appeared to be majority white. The reason these districts (all of which are racially diverse) were not invited was not immediately clear. We have asked both the Department of Education and the White House Press Office for a listing of schools or districts that received tickets but have not yet received a response. A Department of Education spokesperson told us by e-mail that “hundreds of tickets” were provided to “traditional public schools, public charter schools, private schools and home school families” so long as their schools were not on spring break. Although D.C. public schools (DCPS) were closed for spring break during the 17 April 2017 event, Alexandria schools were in session. Arlington schools were closed to students for a “grade preparation day” but like Alexandria had spring break the week before. In the preceding year, DCPS was invited to the 28 March 2016 Easter Egg Roll even though they were on spring break. All three public school districts surrounding the White House are racially diverse. As of 2015, the latest figures available, Alexandria is 36 percent Hispanic, 29 percent black and 27 percent white. Arlington as of October 2016 is 47 percent white, 28 percent Hispanic and 10 percent black. D.C. Public Schools are predominantly African-American — 64 percent of the student body is black as of 2016, while 18 percent are Hispanic and 13 percent are white. (The District of Columbia overall is 48 percent African-American, with whites making up 44 percent and Hispanics totaling nearly 11 percent according to 2015 Census figures.) On 11 April 2017, less than a week from the event, planning for the Trumps’ first Easter Egg Roll seemed to be off to a slow and rocky start. The Times noted that First Lady Melania Trump lives in New York with a limited presence in Washington D.C. and has been slow to hire the staff that would plan such things: The evidence points to a quickly thrown-together affair that people close to the planning said would probably draw about 20,0 people — substantially smaller than last year’s Easter Egg Roll, which drew 37,0. It will be staffed by 500 volunteers, Ms. Grisham said, half the usual. Ms. Grisham said she did not have “firm numbers” on the overall number of attendees, and those who provided estimates did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe the plans for the Easter Egg Roll, which are still evolving just a week before the event. … Washington-area public schools that normally receive blocks of tickets for as many as 4,0 children have yet to hear from the White House, according to representatives for school systems in the District of Columbia; Arlington, Va.; and Alexandria, Va. Several groups representing military families, who have accounted for as many as 3,0 guests in recent years, also said they had yet to be contacted. “I’ve had quite a few families from across the country reach out and say: ‘Hey, are we getting tickets? Our family wants to drive in for the event,’” said Ashley Broadway-Mack, the president of the American Military Partner Association, which represents the families of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender service members and has received tickets for five to 10 of them for each of the last several years. “Unfortunately, the Trump administration has not reached out about it.” … Members of Congress have not received word from the White House about whether they will get tickets to distribute to their constituents. One aide to a Republican lawmaker said White House officials “seem to be a bit behind schedule.” What remains unclear is whether the Trump White House invited more schools and districts thatsimply chose not to attend — Frank Bellavia, spokesperson for Arlington Public Schools told us by phone that even if the district had received tickets, they would not have attended this year, simply because the logistics of transporting and chaperoning hundreds of children at a high-security event is taxing.

{"text": "Caption Close Soldiers in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan opened fire on thousands of demonstrators, killing at least nine and possibly dozens of people Friday after protesters seized a regional government building and stormed a high-security prison in the eastern city of Andijan, freeing thousands of inmates. The protest was the most violent outburst in a slew of demonstrations against 15 years of dictatorial rule of Uzbek President Islam Karimov, a crucial ally of President Bush in the war against terrorism. The uprising presented a challenge for the White House, which says it promotes democracy but has been relying on Karimov's authoritarian government for support. \"American foreign policy always gets itself into these traps,\" said Anatol Lieven, an expert on the region at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"On the one hand it relies on local strongmen, on the other it talks about democracy. This should be a wake-up call for Bush.\" It also poses a challenge to Karimov, who fears that his nation of 25.5 million people might follow the example of its neighbor, the ex-Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan, where protests toppled the repressive government two months ago. Popular uprisings overturned corrupt elections in the former Soviet republics of Ukraine last fall and Georgia in 2003. \"People are being emboldened across the border,\" said Fiona Hill, an expert on Central Asia at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"It's not a coincidence that it happened in Andijan, which is right on the border with Kyrgyzstan.\" Friday's confrontation began after armed civilians freed 2,0 inmates from prison, including 23 Andijan businessmen on trial for alleged Islamic extremism. The imprisoned men belong to Akramia, an Uzbek group that promotes religious freedom. The government permits only a sanctioned form of religious practice, which requires that a sermon distributed by the grand mufti of Tashkent -- handpicked by Karimov -- be read every Friday in every mosque in the country. Human Rights Watch says the imprisoned men are victims of Karimov's repressive regime, which has jailed, tortured or killed more than 7,0 for \"crimes\" that often are nothing more than praying, growing a beard or criticizing the government of this Muslim nation the size of California. \"These people are not Islamic extremists,\" said Rachel Denber, acting director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group that tracks abuses worldwide. \"They believe in Islam separate from the strict guideline of the Uzbek government.\" It is unclear how many Arkamis there are in Uzbekistan. Denber said 16 other Arkamis were arrested in Tashkent, the capital, last year. The movement is named after its founder, Akram Yuldashev, an Islamic dissident sentenced in 19 to 17 years in prison for allegedly urging the overthrow of Karimov in a pamphlet -- a claim he denied. Akramis are the backbone of the small business community of Andijan, a city of 350,0 people in the volatile Fergana Valley. They run a medical clinic and pharmacy, work at a furniture factory and provide employment to thousands of people in a region where the average salary is $4 a month and women and children work at cotton farms and orchards in return for food. \"We are not going to overthrow the government. We demand economic freedom, \" said Abduvosid Egomov, one of the Akramis on trial, who was holed up in the local government compound Friday. \"We are ready to die instead of living as we are living now. The Uzbek people have been reduced to living like dirt.\" The protesters seized the regional government building, setting cars and buildings ablaze. Nine people were killed in clashes with police and 34 wounded, Uzbek government officials said. Protesters said as many as 50 people may have been killed. News reports told of dead bodies lying splayed on the ground. By Friday afternoon, about 4,0 protesters, some with Kalashnikov semiautomatic rifles slung across their chests, massed in the city's central square and voiced from a makeshift podium a litany of complaints about unemployment and grinding poverty. Shortly before dusk, Uzbek security forces drove into the square on a truck and sprayed the crow with bullets. One man wailed, \"Oh, my son! He's dead!\" After that, the news coming out of Andijan became sporadic, making it hard to understand what was happening inside the city. Russian news agencies reported that the Uzbek government forces retook the administrative building, but that large groups of protesters still roamed the city. The gunfire died down as night fell over the city. A witness said he had seen a group of about 100 protesters mowed down by gunfire as they headed to the square. It was impossible to confirm this report. A rights activist, Saidjakhon Zainabiddinov, said late Friday that some of those freed had surrendered to government forces to avoid retaliation. Seeking to prevent the spread of the protest, government forces set up checkpoints around Andijan, blocked access to independent Web sites critical of Karimov's regime and cut off all foreign news broadcasts in Uzbekistan, including CNN, replacing them with music clips. The United States, once one of the more vocal critics of Uzbekistan's human rights violations, has forged close ties with the Uzbek government since Sept. 11, 2001, when it began using an air base in southern Uzbekistan for its military operations in Afghanistan. In a cautious statement Friday, the White House urged restraint by the government and the demonstrators. \"The people of Uzbekistan want to see a more representative and democratic government. But that should come through peaceful means, not through violence, and that's what our message is,\" White House spokesman Scott McClellan said. \"We have had concerns about human rights in Uzbekistan, but we are concerned about the outbreak of violence, particularly by some members of a terrorist organization that were freed from prison.", "label": "false"}

{"text": "For RT His five-day tour of East Africa wraps up on Tuesday and is being viewed as a celebratory “homecoming” for the 44th US president, whose father grew up and is buried in the remote western Kenyan village of Kogelo. As Obama headed north to Ethiopia on the next leg of his tour (it was the first time that any sitting American president has visited that country), one of the most populous on the continent and seen by many as the “spiritual home” of all Africans, owing to its indomitable history of independence from European colonialism. Obama said he was coming to the region to talk about economic trade, investment and security – all with a “tough love” message that African governments must underpin their ambitious development plans with equal attention to human rights. Rights groups urged the president to address the thorny issues of gay equality and freedom of expression when he spoke at a global enterprise summit in Kenya’s capital Nairobi and later at the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. So far, Obama has opted to broach those subjects in rather vague terms, and he has made a point of not letting “certain disagreements” get in the way of otherwise strong bilateral alliances. On the issue of gay rights, Obama told a news conference in Nairobi “everyone should be treated equally under the law” and that it is wrong for the state to discriminate against people simply “because of who they love.” Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta and several members of his ruling administration have been accused of violations against political opponents, while his armed forces are implicated in extrajudicial killings and torture in a counter-insurgency war against Islamist Al Shabaab militants in the eastern region bordering Somalia. The International Criminal Court, however, dropped chargesagainst Kenyatta earlier this year. On the question of gay rights and same-sex marriage, Kenyatta sounded a note of defiance to Obama’s remarks in a shared press conference. The Kenyan leader repeated his previous public assertions that for Kenyans the matter was “a non-issue.” In Ethiopia, the newly re-elected coalition government of Prime Minister Haile-Mariam Desalegn has gained a tarnished reputation for cracking down on journalists and civil society groups critical of his administration. Kenya and Ethiopia are among the fastest growing economies on the 54-nation African continent, which is seen as a future global economic powerhouse owing to vast natural resources in hydrocarbons, metals, minerals and agriculture. This affords a conspicuous new confidence among African leaders, none more so than in Kenya and Ethiopia. On that score, Obama is having to tread carefully while engaging with African leaders – because his “tough love” cuts both ways. First of all, America’s moral capital is not what it used to be. While criticism of African countries over human rights issues can be leveled, such criticism coming from a US president is liable to sound hypocritical and hollow – even if it is voiced by an “honorary son of Africa”. The suspicious suicide of 28-year-old African-American woman Sandra Bland while in custody in a Texas jail has once again highlighted the issue of police violence against blacks and other minorities in the United States. This year alone there have been more than 500 killings by US police officers – nearly three per day – and about 140 of the victims have been African-Americans, according to a studyby the Washington Post. The vast majority of US police officers involved in such cases are white, have not been charged with criminal conduct, nor even sanctioned from their jobs. All too often, say human rights campaigners, the US authorities from the federal to state-level government have turned a blind eye to the accusations of racially motivated and lethal policing. What adds to their chagrin is that Barack Obama – the first African-American president – has been in the White House for seven years and appears to have taken little action to uphold justice for minorities. So, Obama faces a difficult balancing act while in Kenya and Ethiopia this weekend. Both countries can rightly point out that Obama’s words of concern about human rights and civil liberties amount to hypocritical finger pointing. After all, Kenya is caught up in a vicious war with Islamist insurgents. And in Ethiopia, there are seldom-reported cases of police killings of citizens. A second helping of tough love that the American president has to bear in mind is that US investment capital is also not what it used to be. Over the past decade, China has emerged as the pre-eminent strategic business partner of the African continent. Chinese investment and trade with Africa far outweighs the volume of American business with the continent, or indeed compared with the former colonial European states for that matter. According to US think tank Stratfor, China has invested a total of $100 billion across most of Africa’s countries since 2010. That compares with a relatively paltry investment of $14 billion announced earlier this year by the Obama administration. Africa’s annual trade with China has grown by leaps and bounds to around $200 billion compared with the EU-Africa figure of $140 billion and $73 billion for US. China’s prodigious investment is being used to develop infrastructure in transport, urban development and a host of public services, including power utilities, hospitals, schools and universities. Chinese engineers have also brought modern telecommunications to Africa by setting up mobile phone and internet connections that can now reach the remotest village. This is having a transformative impact on development. When Obama addresses the African Union assembly in Addis Ababa later this week, it is no small irony that the new prestigious multi-story AU headquarters were built and opened three years ago thanks to a $200-million gift from the Chinese government. For China, its financial largesse towards Africa has less to do with “humanitarian aid” than simply having to do with good business sense. Through building strategic partnerships across the continent, China has earned concessions and rights to lucrative oil, gas, mineral, agriculture and forestry resources. Beijing knows that the New Silk Routes it is paving across Eurasia with Russia and other partners will need to be fueled with copious supplies of raw materials. Africa is seen by Beijing as a key global partner for fulfilling its own ambitious global development plans. Africa seems suitably content with that arrangement. After centuries of Western-style colonial extraction, the African countries are eagerly receiving the investment capital from China that they need in order to reach their undoubted development potential. Moreover, Chinese investment is conducted without bothersome prying into African internal affairs. So, yes, there has been much emotive hoopla this weekend for Africa’s famous son making a long-awaited homecoming. But as soon as the red carpet is rolled up after Obama’s departure, Africa will be back to bigger business matters with its main strategic partner in China. Obama’s “tough love” dealings with increasingly confident African leaders in Kenya and Ethiopia will thus prove to be a tough sell.

{"text": "S o, you think you’re exceptional? Take a number; so does everyone else. Each nation considers itself singular. The Germans stumbled along their Sonderweg during the 19th century, priding themselves on being such fine and unusual fellows until they were finally kicked into the European and global mainstreams after starting and losing two world wars. In their own estimation, the French are like none other, and their revolution still the wellspring of modernity. Those Scandinavians who find themselves abroad return home like swallows every summer. Nine months in the cesspool that is the world south of the Eider is as much as they can bear. And “How odd of God”, William Norman Ewer once mused, “to choose the Jews.” Simple logic ordains that we can’t all be exceptional. But when Barack Obama, on a trip to the United Kingdom in April 2009, responded to a reporter’s question about what made America exceptional by saying, “I believe in American exceptionalism just as I suspect the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism”, it was as though he had committed some kind of civil-religious heresy. The President wisely steered clear of that heresy during last year’s re-election campaign. Indeed, the late and unlamented campaign season bore witness to national ego-stroking the likes of which have never before been seen. A gaggle of would-be Presidents all but fell over themselves to assure us of our exceptionality. Even Obama’s toned-down rhetoric urged America to live up to its unique destiny. He assured all within earshot that America is the only place where his presidency could have happened. Mitt Romney aimed to make the United States even more exceptional than it already is, notwithstanding the barriers of logic. He and his fellow Republicans want small government, but an even larger military and a more pronounced geopolitical swagger. (No matter that we already vastly outspend our allies and all potential adversaries.) But how can we starve the state, cut taxes and balance budgets while building up the military to the extent they propose? And how can we convince the electorate that its money is well spent protecting European allies who can’t be bothered to spend enough to ensure their own defense? The GOP convention in Tampa also celebrated Neil Armstrong as a hero of American initiative while ignoring his role as a civil servant whose accomplishments were funded by massive government spending (NASA received 4.5 percent of the Federal budget in 1966). There’s “exceptional” logic for you. The loudest undertone in the campaigns was not about military spending, however, but about Europe as model or anti-model for America. Americans faced a choice between contrasting visions of the nation’s future: Should we have government do more in pursuit of some sort of streamlined European social democracy, or should we roll back government to the limited role of a night-watchman state? Nowhere else in the industrialized world are voters offered such a stark alternative. In that, at least, America is exceptional, even if in practice the choice seems always to end up being more rhetorical than real. In the European Union, especially the farther west one goes, the alternatives are a slight tick leftward or a moderate shift to the right from a largely centrist position that is planted firmly to the left of the American middle of the road. Whether Christian Socialist or Social Democrat, Tory or Labour, moderate left or moderate right, all European parties accept a primary social welfare role for the state, and voters accept the need for the requisite taxation to pay for it. How different, really, are the United States and Europe? How exceptional is the United States, and in precisely what ways? These questions make sense because only to the extent that the United States is exceptional relative to its closest kin in political culture can it be said to be exceptional at all. A frequently cited distinction between the United States and Europe is religion: We are religious, and they are not. It seems a rather large difference at first, but there is less here than meets the eye. True, we are a pious people compared to northern Europeans. But it is the secular Europeans who in fact stick out against the backdrop of a resolutely religious world. Between the packed mosques of the Middle East and the empty churches of northern Europe, the United States falls in the moderate center: broadly religious, but so tolerant that we refuse to take the content of theology seriously enough to make a fuss. We have become, in effect, a nation of Unitarians. Take the genuinely offensive basic premise of the Book of Mormon, last year’s musical hit among the coastal elites: All it takes to improve the lives of apparently delusional Africans is a bit of mumbo-jumbo improvised by some adolescent Mormons who were paying too little attention in Sunday school to recall the nonsensical dogma they were sent abroad to preach. Where are the PC police when, for once, you need them? The only ones over here on the American side of the pond to engage in serious theological disputes any longer are proselytizing atheists. With religion’s supposed corollary, science, Americans are even more mainstream. Yes, creationism has more credence and evolution is more contested here than in other developed nations, but Americans’ scientific literacy is as high as or higher than that of most European countries, and our scientific production orders of magnitude greater. Besides, other cultures have their own scientific blind spots. Astrology is taken more seriously in several European nations than it is in the United States. Homeopathy effectively denies scientific causality and is thus arguably less scientific even than creationism, but it’s widely accepted in Europe; indeed, such quackery is often reimbursed by national health plans. Vaccination opponents undermine herd immunity with greater impunity in Europe than here. And the tomfoolery of believing that genetic modification is anything but the rational and efficient pursuit of what humans have been doing through chance, chemicals or radiation since the invention of agriculture has become an article of faith among the European middle classes. More generally, all reputable public opinion surveys show that Americans excel in faith in science and its problem-solving powers. It is hard to take seriously the well-educated, Guardian-reading north London bourgeois who treats his toddlers’ earaches with distilled water, subjects them to measles, mumps or rubella, frets over the provenance of his soy, and then fulminates against the arrant unscientific nonsense of a silly museum of creationism in deepest Appalachia. Into the nexus between religion and science intrudes abortion. We fight about abortion here in the United States, while others in the Western cultural world apparently do not. That makes us exceptional, but only in the sense of actually conducting a discussion over a controversial issue that other nations have shunned altogether. It is a myth that Americans hash out abortion because we are more religious while secular Europeans have achieved a consensus, because they have not. Insofar as Europeans have achieved any consensus, it is only within each nation, each of which has quite different policies. There is no Europe-wide agreement. Moreover, U.S. abortion policy is, by European standards, quite liberal. Women have the right to abort largely at will for many months after conception. Outside the Scandinavian fringe where similar policies are in place, Europeans are much more restricted. German women have to prove various forms of hardship and gain their doctor’s permission. Ireland outlaws abortion almost entirely, and the Mediterranean nations have implemented the Romney position, allowing it only in cases of danger to the mother’s health, incest or rape. Recent attempts to liberalize Spain’s very restrictive policies have sparked huge demonstrations in support of the status quo. In other words, were U.S.-style abortion law rolled out across Europe, you can be sure that their debates would become at least as raucous as ours. T o speak of science is to beg a discussion of its social underpinning, education. Though we spend a lot of energy agonizing about it, we are unexceptional here too—neither much better nor much worse than our Atlantic peers. True, our system of higher education is on a roll: American institutions dominate the top of the international university ratings. Given the resources we pour into them, they ought to. For $35,0 per head annually in tuition, as well as vast infusions of Federal research money and endowment income, it would be sad if we could not produce something first-rate. Our universities are like our health care: world-class in those areas where cash buys quality but enormously expensive and unequally distributed. And like health care, they weigh us down with heavy costs, swallowing resources that might serve better ends. As with health care, our total spending (public and private) on university education is about twice the European average. To some extent we get what we pay for in both instances: world-class services for those lucky enough to receive them. But while our health care extravagance is widely accepted as inefficient, we have only just begun pondering the cost of what we pay for in higher education. After decades of pushing tuition rates far beyond inflation and encouraging students to pile on educational loans, the universities have made themselves complicit in the enormous accumulation of debt. The recent decades’ gold plating of higher education has been financed on the backs of a generation unfortunate enough to be exiting into an unwelcoming labor market. It’s bad enough that medical schools’ massive student loans (almost $250,0 per graduate in the worst cases) require our doctors to be paid more than their peers elsewhere (well over twice the rate for French doctors, for instance), helping drive health care costs skywards. But when freshly minted bachelor’s degree holders in comp lit owe enough to buy a house in Cleveland (median asking price, $130,0), something is askew. And since recent reforms have made it all but impossible to discharge student debt via bankruptcy, we are raising a generation of serfs. In terms of BA-for-the-buck or cost per research citation, others get better outcomes. As Howard Hotson has argued, British universities get similar mileage on fewer resources. Much the same could be said for many European institutions.1 By all means, let our universities enjoy and exploit this fleeting moment in which the world comes to us, but it would be naive to suppose that it will last for very long. Already the tides are turning. Chinese graduate students and faculty are increasingly returning to well-funded institutions at home. If we can build infrastructure quickly, others can too. Founded a mere fifty years ago, UC San Diego today ranks 15th globally in the Academic Ranking of World Universities, compiled annually by the University of Shanghai. Do we really think the Chinese are incapable of achieving the same growth? Below the university level, we are unexceptional in our mediocrity. Shanghai ranks highest on the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment tests. This perhaps could have become our generation’s Sputnik moment, jolting us into action to improve education on a national scale. But on further examination there is nothing extraordinary to see here. A city-state in a country with internal passports, Shanghai has achieved results that are the outcome of selective factors we can only guess at. Of course we should pay attention, but we might as well worry about the nation as a whole failing to meet the Beverly Hills scores. That holds for the Finnish results too, the latest bugbear of the chattering classes. Finland’s performance is largely the happy outcome of a country with the most restrictive immigration policies in Western Europe and a correspondingly homogenous population. No Finnish-as-a-foreign-language lessons there. We can get a sense of such effects from the latest (2007) Trends in International Science and Mathematics study, where Minnesota eighth graders bested everyone but the top-scoring Asian nations. As President Clinton might have put it, our Scandinavians beat their Scandinavians. If we want to worry about competitors, take Canada: A big multicultural nation with problems like ours that nonetheless bests us roundly. If we seek company for our misery, the French and the Germans, equally mediocre, are less worrisome. And, interestingly, the other Scandinavians, with more complex societies than the Finns, do worse than us. What is the mysterious fault line within Scandinavia, otherwise so seemingly uniform from the outside, whereby the Swedes and the Norwegians cannot educate their high school students while the Finns can? T hen there is economic policy, which to judge from recent results has nothing to do with either science or religion. The Republicans complain of excessive regulation choking off growth. We are indeed fairly strict environmental regulators. That’s what makes the air in Los Angeles semi-breathable today and no longer toxic fog. Our cars used to set the emissions standards for the rest of the world. Mandating lead-free gasoline, we forced the Europeans and the Japanese to follow suit. Today, however, Europe and Japan are at least as much leaders as followers. Thus, if we hope to sell our goods abroad, we have to play by the rules set in the largest single consumer market, the European Union. As for those regulations we can still decide entirely on our own, we already do less than most anywhere else in the developed world. The Republicans have gotten their way but seem not to realize it. The U.S. government is less involved in business life than in any European nation except Iceland. Our economic freedom ratings are at the top of the scale, equaled only by the British and the Swiss. Insofar as these things can be quantified, our employers are less tied down by labor regulation and have freer rein to fire than any of their European peers. When hiring, they are as unencumbered as any Europeans. Our minimum wages are low. (The Greeks, Spanish and Portuguese have an even lower minimum wage, but also a lower standard of living. Anyway, who holds them up as paragons any longer?) Our workers get less vacation and work longer hours than most Europeans. How much more an outlier in these respects do Republicans want us to be? In the latest World Economic Forum competitiveness rankings, the United States has slipped to seventh place. Yet our betters are not just the lean and mean like Singapore but the supposedly over-coddled welfare states of Sweden and Finland, not to mention Germany and the Netherlands. Competitiveness rests not just on a stripped-down regulatory structure but on many other variables. One of these is investment in infrastructure for growth. That’s where we lag behind, a deficit that may be laid at the door of both Democrats and Republicans. In broader socio-economic terms, we are no longer exceptional in ways we used to be justly proud of. We imagine ourselves offering wide avenues of social advancement, but however many Horatio Alger look-alike anecdotes are trotted out at the conventions, the statistics are less comforting. In this nation of failing public schools and six-figure student debt, of medical-bill bankruptcy, of infants born without prenatal care and raised without health care, the poor tend to stay poor more consistently than they do elsewhere. Social advancement is now more likely in the high-taxing, high-spending nations of northern Europe and Canada, with their widespread, affordable daycare, state-paid higher education, government-run apprenticeship programs, generous unemployment benefits and other interventions, all of which help their citizens break out of unfortunate circumstances.2 Our crowning achievement remains integrating new arrivals and ethnic minorities. As Paris and London explode in rioting, as Italians attack Roma encampments, as Turks ghettoize themselves in Berlin, we can take satisfaction in charting our progress since our last major moment of civil unrest in Los Angeles twenty years ago. While Europeans agonize over finally introducing some form of affirmative action to integrate outsiders, our own programs have gone a long way toward accomplishing their intent and are slowly approaching the end of their useful lifecycle. Look no further than our prison population to see the difference. In Europe, prisons house mainly foreigners, while in the United States our immigrants are better behaved than native citizens and are actually underrepresented in jail. But it is here that the Republicans would actively make us less exceptional: They advocate a red-state clamp-down on illegal immigration. Nor are we exceptional in other major aspects of domestic policy. Now that Obamacare is here to stay, the one social policy that used to separate us from the rest of the developed world, universal health insurance coverage, is about to vanish too. We pay twice as much per capita as any other nation for health care that grants world-class research and treatment to the best-served. But across-the-board public health results are only run-of-the-mill. For other social policies, we may be miserly, but we are not off the charts. Our local and national pension schemes compare reasonably to public provision elsewhere. But unemployment benefits are brutish and short. Other than some minor tax deductions and Federal regulations on family leave, we have no public provision for maternity or childrearing. Arguably our healthy demographic forecasts (thanks mainly to immigration and first-generation Americans’ reproductive habits) spare us the problem such policies were meant to address. But inasmuch as our teen pregnancy rates have spiked to third-world levels, such inattention probably does not serve us well. I f we are much like other Western industrialized nations in many respects, with only a wiggle here and a twitch of difference there, where can we still thump the drum of exceptionalism? If exceptional means more than just being at one end of a fairly broad spectrum of divergence among developed nations, if it means a black and white difference, then there are only a few areas other than military spending where the United States is off the proverbial charts. But the record in these areas is nothing to be especially happy about. First, we lock up more of our citizens than any other industrialized nation. This is mostly because of how we treat drug-related offenses. Second, Americans own more guns by far than anyone else in the developed world. Third, we kill each other much more often. We have high levels of gun ownership in part because of our relatively large rural population, which likes to hunt in the vast stretches of our country, but also in part because we have a marginalized and heavily armed underclass, abandoned by or immune to the usual engines of assimilation. Because of the threat posed by guns in the hands of gangs and criminals, some average citizens arm themselves, too. Thus lethal violence escalates to far higher rates than elsewhere in the Euro-Atlantic world. True, some other nations are also full of gun buffs, like the Swiss, the Finns and the Swedes. But the Swiss own them as part of their military service, and the Nordic peoples are also eager hunters in sparsely populated countries. Though many, their guns are the rifles and shotguns needed for sport, not the handguns and semi-automatic weapons that wreak havoc in American cities. The NRA would have us believe that gun ownership and murder rates are completely unconnected. Is it really a coincidence that Finns, Swedes and the Swiss also kill each other much more often than other Europeans? (The Norwegians, though big gun owners, are curiously not killers.) Murder aside, nor is the United States uniquely crime-ridden or violent. Marion Barry, Washington, DC’s scandal-prone mayor, was mocked for insisting that Washington had a murder problem, not a crime problem. But he had a point that holds for the nation more generally. For largely all other crimes, the United States falls somewhere near the center of the European incidence distribution. We suffer high rates of certain crimes (some drug use and property crimes) but comparatively little from others (car theft, sexual assault). Our overall incidence of crime is firmly at the center of the European spread. With half as many policemen per capita as the Italians, and generally fewer than other European nations, we cannot thank policing alone for that. But the depressing possibility remains that we achieve our presentable non-murder crime results by locking up far more potential criminals than anyone else. Per capita, our prison rates are at least five times those of the closest European competitors, the British and the Spanish. While we pride ourselves on being a free nation, we are heavyweights in allowing the state to impose directly in this way on the lives of its citizens. When it comes to locking up our most disadvantaged young men, we are in a league of our own. Fixing our inane drug laws would solve much of this, but not all. T hat leaves one final example of America’s Transatlantic exceptionalism: Our tax system is not up to the demands we make of it. As it is in no other nation, raising taxes has become the third rail of American politics. Americans want the best health care money can buy, but don’t want to pay for it. That holds equally for most everything else the state does. For Republicans the contradiction is most obvious for defense: bigger, better, but also magically somehow cheaper. For Democrats, the contradiction afflicts their ambitions for more domestic spending, which is impossible without a major tax overhaul. It’s certainly not for lack of trying. We are already pushing our available tax instruments to the limit. Property taxes are hard to avoid and boast a rough progressivity inasmuch as housing consumption tends to correlate with wealth. Mitt Romney’s car elevator in La Jolla will eventually translate into more money in Sacramento’s coffers. Proposition 13 and the movement against property taxes occurred early in the United States because ours are high. As a percentage of GDP, American property taxes raise well over three times what they do in Germany and twice as much as in high-tax Sweden. Meanwhile, our inheritance and gift taxes fall in the middle of the European range, higher than Germany and the United Kingdom, and much higher than Sweden, where they have recently been abolished altogether. Corporate taxes are hard to measure since businesses shift profits around the world in ways forbidden to most mortals. In the United States they are in the middle of the European pack measured as a fraction of GDP, but at the top if judged by their average effective rate. No doubt our income taxes could be simplified, plugging the loopholes and levying them at higher rates on higher salaries. But their overall incidence is quite comparable to the European average. Their progressivity is higher than the British and Dutch systems, and significantly above the Scandinavians. As a percentage of GDP, they come in above the Dutch, German and French levels, though of course below the Scandinavians. And even the actual amount paid by the average U.S. taxpayer is comparable to European levels: more than the Germans and the British, a bit less than the French. Here is a curious paradox, however: Our total tax take is low by European standards. As a percentage of GDP, it is above only the Greeks, whom we now know to be inveterate tax avoiders. At the same time, our overall tax system is quite progressive. However counterintuitive this may seem, the richest 10 percent pay a larger share of total taxes in the United States than in any West European nation. How is this possible? The dirty little secret of the American fiscus is our refusal thus far to harness the workhorse of most other tax systems: indirect and consumption levies. Of our low tax take, much is raised from progressive sources: income, property, corporate tax. In Europe, the lower middle and working classes participate heavily in financing the social benefits they receive, thanks in large part to pervasive value-added taxes (VAT). Consider that the poorest half of all American households pay no income tax whatsoever, and the overall redistributive effect of the U.S. tax system becomes even more evident. In other rising economies the generally regressive nature of the tax system is even more pronounced, Brazil being an excellent example. We in the United States are locked into a highly redistributive tax system, while in Europe the movement of monies better resembles Brownian motion, circulating as much within classes as between them. Generous social benefits are heavily clawed back by taxes. The single Swedish mom who receives a child benefit pays income tax on it and then a 25 percent VAT when she buys a stroller. She knows what she gets for her taxes and is tied into the system both as recipient and payer. When her child grows up, she in turn will help finance similar benefits for those who are now in similar situations. Since they receive no obvious direct benefits, the American middle and upper classes resist further expansion of income taxes. Indirect taxes, in turn, are resisted from all sides. Having never met a tax it likes, the Right rejects them on principle. The Left cannot warm to them because they are undeniably regressive. One major reason we cannot break our current stalemate is the implicit bargain at the core of the U.S. tax system. Taxes are part of our welfare state by the back door, and fiscal policy is caught up in larger dilemmas. However desirable fiscally, and however useful to reward energy efficiency, we cannot raise gas taxes or readily move to a system of user fees because there are few alternatives to the car. Because we cannot offer the working classes effective mass transit in most places in the United States, we cannot make driving a middle-class luxury, as it remains in Europe. And because we are denied the revenues from higher gas taxes, we cannot build mass transit. Our transportation dilemma is emblematic of larger problems. Though we are approaching the limits of what is politically possible to extract via other tax instruments, we cannot shift to consumption taxes. Since wages at the bottom of the scale are low and our social benefits paltry, we must find other ways of channeling resources to the poor. The first demand to our tax system is therefore that it should be Hippocratic: above all, do no harm. America is increasingly divided into those who pay no direct taxes and those who pay the lion’s share. In Europe, where more citizens both pay and receive, the political battle lines are less clearly etched. A merica was once exceptional, but it is no longer. In the 19th century, for example, we were the copyright rogues of the world. Denying foreign authors rights to their works, we reprinted them cheaply and spread them widely to improve our literacy and educational levels. At Hollywood’s behest, we are today the world’s copyright policemen. We prevent the Indians from producing generic drugs, slap adolescent downloaders with massive fines and shut down Google’s attempts to digitize the world’s books. The same holds for many other policies. For better or worse, we belong to the developed world and have to play by its rules. The Republicans lost in 2012 not only because they moved to the fringes of domestic politics, but also because they are out of touch with global realities. They seek to position America as a stark outlier in a world where in fact we increasingly fit in. With the exception of integrating foreigners, where we can be justly proud of our record, we are ever more like other developed nations. The well-worn bit about how different we and the Europeans are was never really true, and these days it’s less so than ever. In those fields where we remain exceptional we should ask ourselves whether we like the company we keep: South Africa and Colombia for our murder rate, China for the death penalty, and towering over even Russia for our levels of imprisonment. Like everyone, Americans enjoy feeling unusual, but not all distinctions are created equal. After all, it’s one thing to achieve genuine greatness, but another to be just a freak. 1Hotson, “Don’t Look to the Ivy League”, Times Literary Supplement, May 19, 2011. 2See Jo Blanden et al., “Intergenerational Mobility in Europe and North America”, Centre for Economic Performance, Sutton Trust (April 2005).", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Killed elephant with tusks removed — a victim of the ivory trade. Here’s a fact: every 15 minutes of every day an elephant is killed because of its ivory. And here’s what an expert contends is a fact-to-be: within 12 years elephants will be extinct, the victim largely of poachers who sell their ivory and customers who buy it. The expert: Dr Dame Daphne Sheldrick, talking from charity’s base in Nairobi National Park, in Kenya. Monday was World Elephant day — and if she’s correct there may not be too many of them left: Conservationist Dr Dame Daphne Sheldrick revealed an elephant is being killed every 15 minutes in Africa to supply an insatiable and unsustain-able demand for ivory. From her charity’s base in Nairobi National Park, she said: “Today is World Elephant Day but in 12 years’ time there may not be any elephants left in Africa to celebrate. “A world without elephants is hard to comprehend, but it is a real possibility. Against a submachine gun or poacher armed with a spear, they stand little chance.” About 36,0 elephants in Africa were slaughtered last year despite a ban on ivory. They fall victim to highly organised and well-armed gangs. In Kenya, 162 elephants out of a population of 35,0 were killed by poachers between January and July. Ivory is in soaring demand in the Far East for trinkets. Dame Daphne, 79, said that in just two raids last month Kenyan authorities seized 4½ tons of ivory. In Hong Kong at the same time, Customs obtained more than 1,100 tusks. Dame Daphne, who heads the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust named after her late husband, said captured contra-band is thought to equate to just 10 per cent of actual smuggling. She picks up the pieces of this grisly trade by helping orphaned elephants. The main culprit? China: “When it comes to elephant killing, and indeed most of the illegal trade in wildlife, all roads lead to China,” writes Philip Mansbridge, CEO of Care for the Wild International, on HuffPo. “Some of you may think that this is a sweeping generalisation, but the truth is it’s not. Yes – there are many other markets for ivory right now, but the biggest and most insatiable appetite comes from China without any shadow of a doubt – this is common fact. “Whilst China should be recognised in some part for stepping up their fight against wildlife crime recently, they should also be condemned for their inability to even partially quash this demand, which has increased rapidly with the emergence of a new, wealthier, middle class.” Want to help organizations take action? Visit Care for the Wild International and the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust to learn more. Mansbridge’s post begins with this: It’s hard to imagine that anyone reading this blog isn’t already aware that right now elephants are in crisis. For many years, leading global conservationists and charities have been doing all they can to stop the killing of elephants to fuel the illegal ivory trade – some behind the scenes and some in the public eye, but all fighting a common cause. Over the last few years the issue has escalated beyond any experts’ predictions, and the elephant slaughter has increased at a truly unprecedented rate. This dramatic escalation coupled with the press-friendly voices of celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Yao Ming (one of China’s most widely known public figures), Kristin Davis, and more recently high profile politicians such as Barack Obama, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton, has now, thankfully, brought this tragic story back to the front of the public’s mind. So, on World Elephant Day, just how bad is this crisis? It’s bad. Elephant poaching across Africa has reached an unprecedented high and now looks set to wipe out our beloved elephants from the planet in as little as 20 years. Some reports are now suggesting that up to 40,0 elephants are being killed for their tusks each year in Africa alone. That is almost five per hour, every hour, every day. Can you imagine this – five per hour – think for one minute about how that equates to your day. What will you do in the next 12 minutes? Maybe read this blog, surf the net, clear a couple of emails, make a coffee… bang. Another magnificent elephant hits the ground. In minutes his tusks will be removed, usually by cutting most of the face off, often by chainsaw. An intelligent, social elephant with complex communication and family structures, that may have walked around its land in peace for the last 60-70 years, now dead and soon to be a trinket. This is not only unsustainable and cruel – it is barbaric. Read it in its entirety. But it’s not just elephants that are at risk due to poachers: Rinos could also be wiped out. This week the AP had this: Kenyan Wildlife Service officials say armed poachers shot and killed a white rhino and cut off its horn in Nairobi National Park, the first poaching death of a rhino in the urban park in six years. The killing brings to 35 the number of rhinos killed in Kenya so far this year, a sharp rise from the 29 killed in total in 2012. A key market to blame for the market for these butchered animals? Celebrity icons: How celebrity fashion icons fuel illegal poaching and leopard extinction is a controversial topic because once again in the news Wednesday, August 7, 2013 a mother load of ivory tusks, rhino horns, and leopard skins was seized by Hong Kong customs officials. Leopard skins, ivory tusks and rhino horns displayed during a press conference fuel controversial questions like how can this crime against wildlife and humans continue? How can we stop celebrity icons and their need for fashion fur? Customs officials at the Kwai Chung cargo examination compound seized the five million dollar haul containing 1,120 ivory tusks, 13 rhino horns and five pieces of leopard skin after searching a container declared as wood from Nigeria. Leopard skins bound to be made into high ticket garments no doubt to drap over the shoulders of celebrities like Kate Moss, Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Kim Kardashian. A new tool against poachers: drones. Unmanned aerial vehicles are being deployed to stem the killing of rhinos in Africa. The exact location of the anti-poaching operation is secret, as is the number of rangers who will be on duty. Also confidential: where the drones will fly as they search out poachers intent on slaying rhinos for their horns – one killed every 11 hours in South Africa alone. But over several days, Tom Snitch thinks that his project, at a private game farm adjoining South Africa’s famed Kruger National Park, will prove that unmanned aerial vehicles can end the scourge of rhinoceros poaching. Demand for rhino horn has boomed in recent years, with criminal syndicates offering as much as US$30,0 (RM96,0) a pound (450g) for the horns. Poachers have already killed 515 rhinos in South Africa this year; last year, 668 endangered rhinos died for their horns. They’re sold in Asia, particularly in Vietnam, where ground-up horns are touted as a cure for hangovers, cancer and other ailments, and where rising incomes have made the horns accessible to more people and their possession a status symbol. Save the Rhino International, a conservation group, won’t talk about the street value of rhino horn, saying that any mention “stimulates poaching”. And so the war to preserve the elephants, and the rinos from the people who kill them and sell parts of their bodies, and the rich people who buy the products made from the dead animals, goes on. Those battling to save the animals include Wildlife Works rangers in East and Southern Africa. Here’s another fact: If this battle is lost, there is no possibly of a comeback.

{"text": "Terrorism and intelligence experts have known for years that the encrypted messaging application Telegram is now the \"app of choice\" for terrorists, and specifically for ISIS. The ISIS members behind the 2015 Paris attacks used Telegram to spread propaganda. ISIS also used the app to recruit the perpetrators of the Christmas market attack in Berlin last year and claim credit for the massacre. More recently, a Turkish prosecutor found that the shooter behind the New Year's Eve attack at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul used Telegram to receive directions for it from an ISIS leader in Raqqa. Despite all this, the app hasn't faced any formal pressure to crack down on the terrorist groups on its platform - until now. On Wednesday, Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov, who is from Russia, agreed to provide basic information about the company to the Russian government after it threatened to ban Telegram for enabling terrorist attacks. This came days after Russia's main security agency, the FSB, said it had \"reliable information\" that terrorists used Telegram to plan the deadly St. Petersburg attack that killed 15 people in April. The Russian government seems appeased for now, but the debate surrounding Telegram's role in terrorism isn't going away. Government agencies are going to continue demanding that Telegram release more of its user information or provide a \"back door\" for intelligence agencies to access encrypted messages, and Telegram is going to continue fighting them. On Wednesday, Durov emphasized that the company wouldn't share confidential user data with anyone even though it's passing over some basic information about Telegram to the Russian government. This is because privacy isn't just one of Telegram's features; it's Telegram's brand. Launched in 2013, the company has marketed the app as a secure messaging platform in a world where all other forms of digital communication seem trackable. It has arguably become the most popular app of its kind - garnering more than 100 million monthly active users as of 2016 - by promising features such as end-to-end encryption (which prevents anyone except the sender and receiver from accessing a message), secret chatrooms, and self-destructing messages. \"Its reputation is as the medium that can't be decrypted,\" says Ahmet S. Yayla, a counterterrorism expert from George Mason University who has spent two years tracking ISIS on social media. \"People love the idea of privacy.\" Durov isn't about to give up that branding. The deal he signed with the Russian government on Wednesday shows that he's willing to compromise somewhat if it means keeping the 6 million Telegram users in Russia, but not that he's backing down from maintaining the app's reputation. Telegram's unique features will continue to attract and be used by those who value secrecy, and, at least for now, that includes terrorists. Telegram did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this article. Government agencies tend to get preoccupied with Telegram's encryption technology, but that in itself isn't what draws terrorists to the app, says Jade Parker, a senior research associate at the TAPSTRI research group who specializes in terrorists' use of the internet. Users on Telegram can communicate in channels, groups, private messages, or secret chats. While channels are open to anyone to join (and thus used by terrorist groups to disseminate propaganda), secret chats are virtually impossible to crack because they're protected by a sophisticated form of encryption. The combination of these different functions in a single platform is why groups like ISIS use Telegram as a \"command and control center,\" Parker says. \"They congregate on Telegram, then they go to different platforms. The information starts in the app, then spreads to Twitter, Facebook.\" It's the fact that the app integrates several important functions into one platform that draws groups like ISIS to it, Parker explains. But this isn't something government agencies see. Instead, they tend to zoom in on just one of Telegram's functions: its secret chats. Secret chats are protected by end-to-end encryption. How this works is that every user is given a unique digital key when they send out a message. To access that message, the receiver has to have a key that matches the sender's exactly, so that messages from any one user can only be read by the intended recipient. This makes it almost impossible for middlemen such as police or intelligence agencies to access the flow of information between the sender and receiver. Even if police can identify who is speaking to whom, and from where, they have no way of knowing what they're saying to each other. In fact, because the encryption happens directly between the two users, even Telegram itself has no way of knowing what's in these messages. Telegram isn't the only messaging app that uses end-to-end encryption (others include WhatsApp and Viber), but the app takes its commitment to security one step further with snazzy functions such as a self-destruct timer. Before a user sends a message in a secret chat, they can choose to set a self-destruct timer on it, which means that some time after the message has been read, it automatically and permanently disappears from both devices. And as Parker pointed out, it's not just the security that terrorist groups like. It's that this security comes coupled with other functions. Terrorist groups are rapidly expanding organizations, and that means it's incredibly useful to be able to receive a confirmation video from an attack through a secret chat and immediately blast it out to more than 1,0 followers in a channel as propaganda. Compared with other social media platforms, Telegram has extremely low barriers to entry. All users have to do to set up an account is provide is a cellphone number, to which the app then sends an access code. According to both Yayla and Parker, it's common practice for terrorists to supply one cellphone number to set up their account but use another to actually operate the account. \"The SIM card you use to open your Telegram account and the SIM card you actually use on the phone with the application don't have to the same,\" Yayla explained. \"So you can be the fakest person in the world.\" Not only does this make it harder for law enforcement officials to track down terrorists through Telegram, it also makes it easier for terrorists to set up a new account once they discover their previous one has been exposed to the police. Another attractive feature of the app is that it's really quite hard to get booted off it. Two years ago, ISIS's preferred social media platform was Twitter, not Telegram, says Todd Helmus, an expert on terrorism and social media at the RAND Corporation. But Twitter, along with other mainstream platforms like Facebook and Instagram, has since gone out of its way to take down ISIS accounts, pushing the group out of the app. In August 2016, Twitter said it had taken down 360,0 terrorist-related accounts in the past year alone. While Telegram has also cracked down on ISIS-operated channels - it shut 78 down in the wake of the 2015 Paris attacks, and has since taken down hundreds more - its efforts don't seem to compare to those of other platforms, which some experts think is driving terrorists toward the app. \"Telegram is not very reliable in shutting down these [ISIS-operated] channels,\" says Yayla, who has spent the past two years joining and tracking these channels on Telegram. While Telegram has said that terrorist-run channels are taken down within hours, Yayla says he is currently following an ISIS-run channel that has been operating freely for the past two weeks. This isn't necessarily because Telegram isn't working as hard to counter terrorist material, but because the nature of the app makes it much more difficult to selectively prohibit users, Parker says. Telegram can go after ISIS-related channels, but it rarely ever shuts down anyone's account (and even if it did, it would take a user mere seconds to set up another one). This means that when ISIS's propaganda channels are shut down, they can easily set up a bunch of other replacement channels - which, in fact, is exactly how they've been responding to crackdowns. \"You can create a new channel within 30 seconds. So now, instead of opening three channels, [ISIS] opens 50 channels to spread propaganda,\" she notes. \"Deleting their channels doesn't put a dent in their activity.\" To Yayla, there's no doubt that Telegram needs to do more, though he doesn't think that banning the app, or threatening to do so, is the right way forward. \"If Telegram is blocked in Russia, terrorists will be able to find another applications in just one or two days,\" he says. \"Yes, it will be inconvenient, but it won't stop them.\" Telegram representatives make the same argument. In a blog post titled \"Don't Shoot The Messenger,\" Telegram spokesperson Markus Ra said banning Telegram or forcing the app to remove its encryption service will only push terrorists to source out other alternatives, many of which are readily available. In fact, ISIS members are already using other encrypted messaging apps such as Chat Secure and Jabber along with Telegram, and they're on the lookout for more, says Parker. \"Shutting down Telegram . ISIS is just going to move somewhere else,\" Parker says, adding that the recent buzz around Telegram has already prompted ISIS leaders to look into moving some of their social media presence onto a San Francisco-based application called Baaz. This, of course, doesn't mean that nothing should be done. It just means that the threat Russia issued to Telegram earlier this week is a simplistic reaction to a really complicated problem. Governments do need to find a way to stop terrorist organizations from abusing some of the powerful functions in these applications, but blustering to ban these apps isn't going to do it.", "label": "true"}
{"text": "If you think the Deepwater Horizons oil blowout disaster, the worst in the nation’s history, is horrific, add this to the on-going horror story: An exhaustive investigative report by the Associated Press released Wednesday said there are more than 27,0 abandoned wells in the Gulf and 17% or 4,590 could be leaking. Abandoned off-shore Gulf wells are not inspected but the rate of abandoned wells on land that leak is that 17% factor. The AP said there was concern for at least 3,500. The AP investigation said federal rules for “temporarily abandoned” wells in the Gulf are routinely circumvented and about 1,0 wells in that category have not been checked for decades. Geology experts say years of exposure to sea water and underground pressure can cause cementing and piping to corrode much as a volcano can awaken. Industry spokesmen quoted in the AP story deny such events can happen if the wells are plugged properly. It is true that the technological process has improved in recent years but not to older wells sealed in the Gulf dating back to the 1940s. “There has been a few occasions where wells that have been plugged have to be entered and re-plugged,” said Greg Rosenstein, a vice president at Superior Energy Services, a New Orleans company that specializes in this work for offshore wells. The AP report maintains the rules set down by the Minerals Management Service, now the Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement agency, lack teeth and rely solely on paperwork provided to them by the industry. In California, it said, state inspectors sealed “several dozen” abandoned offshore wells, and in Texas,more than 21,0 abandoned wells were plugged to control pollution, according to that state’s comptroller’s office. “In deeper federal waters, though — despite the similarities in how such wells are constructed and how sealing procedures can fail — the official policy is out-of-sight, out-of-mind,” the AP said. It reported MMS fined seven companies $440,0 between 2003 and 2007 for improper plug-and-abandonment work. The report concludes no one really knows how many abandoned wells are leaking — and how badly because they don’t want to know. Both the government and industry appear unconcerned. As an example, a team of researchers tried to locate a well 20 miles off Louisiana reported leaking five years after it was abandoned. Satellite radar images were no help because MMS withheld critical information that could have helped verify and locate the well. John Amos, the geologist who wrote the study, said “I kind of suspected that this was a project almost designed to fail.” He said the agency refused to tell him “how big and widespread a problem” they were dealing with in the Gulf. Other incidents of failure to respond: — A General Accountability Office report warned of Gulf offshore leaks from abandoned wells as far back as 1994 and asked for inspections. None. — A 2001 study by MMS said its agents were “concerned that some abandoned oil wells in the Gulf may be leaking crude oil.” Nothing done. ———————— EPILOGUE As early as the first week in May following the April 20 blowout and explosion that killed 11 crew on the Deep Horizons platform two days later I began reporting the story consistently in terms of a worst case scenario. I was accused of being an alarmist. The facts to this day prove me correct. The Gulf oil disaster keeps getting worse and it is not a bad dream. The combined effort of the MMS regulatory agency turning over the role of safety inspections to, in this case, BP and failure to offer a proven plan to address a blowout of this proportion at a depth of 5,0 feet — or any feet — below the Gulf surface by all the operators of the 4,0 active and 2,700 abandoned wells is a criminal disgrace. It is not an issue of limited regulation or too much regulation. It is a case of greed trumping accepted common sense. Whereas the banks that were too large to fail, here we have a blowout both the industry and government said would never happen. It did. And it was not a 6,700-to-1 longshot that it did despite what the oil industry and southern governors indebted to the oil industry for revenue and jobs are telling you. For the naysayers who contend no leaks from abandoned wells have been found and why stir up this pot of hysteria, I say, seek and thou shalt find. If no one is in the forest, how can they know if a tree fell to the ground.", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Mutual Exchange is the Center’s goal in two senses—we favor a society rooted in peaceful, voluntary cooperation, and we seek to foster understanding through ongoing dialogue. Mutual Exchange will provide opportunities for conversation about issues that matter to the Center’s various publics. A lead essay, deliberately provocative, will be followed by responses from inside and outside of C4SS. Contributions and comments from readers are enthusiastically encouraged. Jeremy Weiland’s essay, Class Struggle in Civil Service: Viewing Public Sector Unions Through the Lens of Class Theory,offers us a third way to look at the outcome ofGovernorScott Walker’s controversial victory in Wisconsin.Instead of seeing it as a Republican – Tea Party – Conservative “victory” for the taxpayer over biggovernmentand unions or as aDemocrat – Progressive – Liberal “defeat” of collective bargaining and community agency in the face of Corporate interests and campaign mega-spending, Weiland suggests that we (again – this article was originally published on March 15th, 2011 in response to the last electoral battle in Wisconsin)regard this as an opportunityto “resurrect” class struggle. *** I support the public sector unions opposing Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker’s agenda. While I’m neither a fan of government nor the civil service, it’s clear that the so-called lavish benefits and salaries public sector unions defend against Republican encroachment represent not entrenched privilege but merely the last vestiges of a minimally fair employment deal. The last forty years have seen this deal eviscerated in the private sector, and it is only in comparison to the current paltry influence of contemporary labor that public sector unions seem pampered. One need not single out individual teachers to critique public schooling, for instance – in any case, the idea that a school teacher is grifting me provokes involuntary laughter. As a Wobbly, however, the ideology of class struggle informs my activism on labor. Solidarity is never unconditional, as my friend Chris Lempa pointed out to me in a letter. True common purpose in the struggle against bosses must be framed in terms of legitimate class theory in order not to degenerate into the business-as-usual, reformist, junior-partner-in-the-ruling-class unionism that has prevailed since the Wagner Act. And so while I support public sector unions in this conflict, I find it difficult to place them in the traditional model of class struggle. In the private sector the class dynamics are clear: workers and bosses can be easily seen as in zero-sum competition. One gains at the expense of the other, the prize is effective control over the means of production, and the players line up along the party whose control they favor. Customers and suppliers represent the third parties who, while not powerless in the equation, tend to deal with the organization as a whole on a voluntary basis. The adversarial relationship is more centered inside the organization, and market pressures from the third parties are accepted as a given. Much of the decline in labor power has arisen from capital’s superior marketing of the narrative that union gains come at consumer losses. This analysis falls apart when applied to the public sector. The government has no equivalent market pressures to which it is compelled to respond. As a monopoly producer, government has every incentive to pacify its workforce by delivering higher wages and benefits. The taxpaying consumer of these services is without recourse. Politicians cannot be seen as perfect analogs of the boss class, nor can civil service management be viewed in the same sense as private sector management. Indeed, to invoke the oft-cited preamble to the IWW constitution, does the public sector working class and the public sector employing classreallyhave nothing in common? As a former public school teacher, my wifeoffered me an example of organizational dynamics in the public sector that might better explain the class disposition of the various players. Who is the favored class within the public schooling institution? Surely not teachers – they are serially overworked and underpaid, but even more importantly from a radical labor perspective, they enjoy little control over the workplace. In fact, the history indicates that teachers have been viewed by the establishment as nearly as much in need of control and discipline as the students they teach. Curricula are designed not merely to guide student learning but, to the greatest extent possible, make classrooms teacher-proof. The fear has always been that a genuine relationship between teachers and students would be harmful to the institution as a whole, and so a factory model guided the development of modern pedagogy. So, who is exploiting teachers? Who is denying them control of work conditions? Who is playing them off against the end consumers (students and parents) to limit their power and influence? It would easy to say: the public, through their designated politicians, from the Governor down to the School Board. However, the public has very coarse control over the schools (or any government function) through political means. The public is not the “boss class” in any meaningful way, least of all because they desire maximum effort from teachers at a minimum wage. They are imprisoned customers given a modicum of choice but no exit, and as they work for a living just like teachers they are more likely to see their interests aligned than opposed. What about the politicians? Surely they have outsized control, at least as the managers. They seek to maximize their own control over the institution and position themselves for personal political advantage in the larger establishment. While market pressures may not factor in directly, they still have to deal with budget pressures, balancing interests among the entire government. The relative competition may not originate in the market so much as among the interest groups of the state: those seeking to grow one department’s budget at another’s expense, or those who favor capital over government power and fight taxes. But even if politicians are the boss class, that is still insufficient to explain organizational dynamics within the school. Where is the class managing affairs on a daily basis on the boss’s behalf? Who implements the control over workers? Who sees their interests as more aligned with the bosses than with the workers? The answer is obvious when you think about it. The school administration is the management class of public schooling. They are the class with fat salaries, minimal work to do, and an interest in running the school as a factory. They prefer stability to true empowerment and education. They hold both teachers and students in check. Their class actually grows pretty steadily, soaking up funds from those who actually teach, while implementing stupid policies like zero tolerance to subsume more and more of the classroom under their direct management. I’ve focused on public schooling, but I imagine this model could apply to just about any civil service field. You have the people who do the work – in a zoning office, for instance, it’s the clerks and surveyors and those who actually affect the end product. Then you have the city administration and the Mayor / Board of Supervisors / etc., which use the institution as a means to a political career focused on directing others and taking credit for it. They don’t care about zoning per-se; their interest is in stabilizing the organization so they can grow the parasite administrative class and pursue their agenda of personal aggrandizement and its ideological trappings (set aside your feelings about zoning laws in general for a moment). As a Wobbly and a mutualist, then, I’d like to see radical labor take a stand that does not simply provide unconditional solidarity to public workers, but pushes them to take increasingly radical stances on issues of workplace control. What do we want: state-recognized and -enforced collective bargaining rights, or a movement so powerful it can operate without the state’s permission? Are we fighting for a bit higher wage and benefits for public workers, or an end to the wage system? Do we want civil servants to be treated with slightly more respect by their overlords, or do we instead demand worker control of these capital-serving institutions? After all, we’ve established that public sector unions are the last vestiges of something approach a fair deal between labor and capital. Perhaps we should remind capital why they sought to give us that deal to begin with, thus securing a better position for labor in all sectors. To accomplish this, Wobblies and all radical unionists must reassert the primacy of the class struggle and creatively compose the narrative that frames the public and private sector worker grievances in class terms. Only a rebirth of class consciousness will push the center of the labor movement leftwards and secure our interests. It’s not enough to defeat Governor Walker or even to respond to these periodic crises in labor relations with solidarity: we have to resurrect the class struggle.", "label": "true"}

The CDC has yet to respond to a question about whether the agency addressed the email exchange with Roark or Adams, and whether either was reprimanded or punished. Judicial Watch said it obtained the emails as part of an investigation into the CDC activating its Emergency Operations Center to deal with tens of thousands Central American immigrants, including many unaccompanied minors, trying to get into the United States at the Mexico border. The center was opened to address concerns about the border-crossers’ health and the potential for them to bring contagious diseases and other illnesses into the country. The Roark-Adams exchange was included in about 3,0 pages of emails obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, and more documents related to the Judicial Watch investigation are forthcoming, the group said Monday. The U.S. law that gives some protection to illegal immigrants from non-bordering countries — and puts unaccompanied minors into the hands of the Department of Health and Human Serv ices — was in fact signed by President George W. Bush in December 2008, days before Obama took off ice. Judicial Watch also found in its investigation a June 18, 2014, email in which CDC intell igence analyst Daniel Bubacz said the situation that summer was the result of a “Leave No Child on the other Side of the Border Policy” — a reference to the controversial federal education policy known as No Child Left Behind.

Barack Obama wanted the American public to believe that these children are innocent and vulnerable and have no place to go, well too bad our nation isn't a lost-and-found box. The effect that these programs have on our nation is horrible, and they are greatly harming our economy. We are all aware that many people are taking advantage of the benefits we can offer, so having as much as they can arrive poured in our country and living off of the backs of taxpayers while they are raping and pillaging is something that we will not stand for. It is known for a fact that the illegals don't care about what is real and what is fiction, and no they don't thank the leftist ideology for holding them here either. If you ask us, a 17-year old sexually assaulting a woman should not be excused just because the minor can't be tried as an adult.

{"text": "The city of Berkeley, Calif., shows how to take serious action on climate disruption by paying up-front costs to help residents switch to solar power. This could be done at any scale, from village to nation. All that is needed is wisdom and an understanding that any \"ROI\" (return on investment) calculation that doesn’t include the risk that failure to respond to climate disruption will bankrupt us (in addition to its moral bankruptcy) isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on. Berkeley is set to become the first city in the nation to help thousands of its residents generate solar power without having to put money up front — attempting to surmount one of the biggest hurdles for people who don’t have enough cash to go green. The City Council will vote Nov. 6 on a plan for the city to finance the cost of solar panels for property owners who agree to pay it back with a 20-year assessment on their property. Over two decades, the taxes would be the same or less than what property owners would save on their electric bills, officials say. … This is how Berkeley’s program would work: A property owner would hire a city-approved solar installer, who would determine the best solar system for the property, depending on energy use. Most residential solar panel systems in the city cost from $15,0 to $20,0. The city would pay the contractor for the system and its installation, minus any applicable state and federal rebates, and would add an assessment to the property owner’s tax bill to pay for the system. The extra tax would include administrative fees and interest, which would be lower than what the property owner could obtain on his own, because the city would secure low-interest bonds and loans, officials say. The tax would stay with the property even if the owner sold, although the owner would have to leave the solar panels. The property owner would save money on monthly Pacific Gas &amp; Electric bill because electricity generated by the solar panels would partly replace electricity delivered by the utility. After the assessment expired, the solar panels — of a simple technology that requires little or no maintenance — would continue to partly replace PG&amp;E electricity … … For more information about Berkeley’s energy-saving initiatives, go to For information on California’s incentives and rebates for installing solar panels, go to or", "label": "false"}
{"text": "So a lawmaker, a lobbyist, and a football coach walk into a plaintiff’s bar… If that sounds like the beginning of a joke, journalists in South Carolina might not be laughing. Those are some pretty upper-echelon positions in the Palmetto State—and it just so happens that they’re the occupations of people who have recently sued a range of news organizations across the state for libel. The football coach sued an alternative weekly in Charleston (and has been sued in return). A member of the state House of Representatives is suing a prominent political blogger near the state’s capital. And, in the case that’s made headlines most recently, a state appeals court has upheld a substantial judgment in favor of a lobbyist who successfully sued the Myrtle Beach Sun News. Altogether, the cases cut quite a swath across the state’s media landscape. The Sun News case stems from a series of articles written in 2010 about campaign contributions in the governor’s race by investigative reporter David Wren, now of the Charleston Post and Courier. A lobbyist identified in the stories sued—nearly two years later—saying the coverage had damaged his reputation by indicating he had run afoul of ethics laws. The defense argued there was nothing factually incorrect in the stories, which had primarily focused on the source of the funding, and the lobbyist was interpreting some language improperly. A jury ruled for the lobbyist and awarded $400,0 in actual damages and $250,0 in punitive damages. Last week, a panel from the South Carolina Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the verdict. Jay Bender, the state’s preeminent First Amendment attorney and the paper’s lawyer in the case, says he’ll ask the appeals court to re-consider, and if that fails he plans to petition the state Supreme Court. “I think the court did not apply the correct constitutional standard in evaluating the evidence,” Bender said. Whatever the outcome, the newspaper has sunk money into the lawsuit it will never recover. I can’t say for sure whether this cluster of cases in the news is part of an uptick in litigation against media outlets—apparently, there’s no good database tracking libel suits against news organizations (so if you’re an aspiring media law researcher, get on that!) Still, it got me thinking: Is South Carolina, where I worked as a journalist for the better part of the last decade, a place where reporters have to be especially wary? There’s some reason to think the answer is yes. “From the press’s perspective, it’s fair to say that South Carolina’s courts have struggled to apply the First Amendment and other liberalizing trends to the old common law of libel,” said Dave Heller, deputy director of the Media Law Resource Center, a membership group for media outlets and defense lawyers based in New York. The idea that the state’s libel and defamation law is a messy mix of different frameworks has a long pedigree—it was summed up most famously by Jean Toal, the former chief justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court, who described certain areas of the law as “mind-numbingly incoherent” in a 1998 opinion. “[T]he law lacks consistency and predictability, and confounds the bench, the bar, members of the general public, and media personnel who have to make important decisions based on court precedent,” she wrote at the time. Toal, who is still an active senior judge in the state’s court system, didn’t want to offer an updated assessment for this story. Asked if she might recommend another expert, she suggested Bender—not a disinterested source, clearly, but one who knows the territory. For his part, Bender pointed to a few factors that make South Carolina unique. For one, the state has a relatively long statute of limitations for filing a libel suit—two years where in most states it’s one, he said. For another, Bender said, in his experience judges there are less likely to grant summary judgment, so cases are more likely to get in front of a jury. And jurors don’t necessarily like the press or value journalists’ self-appointed role of pointing out corruption and malfeasance. (OK, maybe that last part is not so unique to South Carolina, though this is the only state where a lawmaker has proposed a “ responsible journalism registry.”) There also could be something else at play, Bender added: It probably goes back to history where we’ve had in South Carolina this huge commitment to the protection of reputation, which is why we probably had a lot of duels in South Carolina compared to other places because we’re going to protect reputation at the point of a gun. Fortunately no newspaper man that I know of has been killed by a gun since N.G. Gonzales, the editor of The State, was shot by the lieutenant governor. But it’s dangerous in terms of liability. That’s colorful stuff. (The lieutenant governor got off, by the way, despite plenty of witnesses to that 1903 murder. There used to be more hazardous things to worry about than plaintiffs’ briefs.) Unsurprisingly, one of the state’s leading plaintiff’s attorneys in defamation cases sums up the situation a little differently. “I think reputation is extremely important. Once lost it is never gained,” says John E. Parker, the attorney for both the football coach and the lawmaker in those two pending suits. He doesn’t see the state’s approach to libel and slander as notably different than elsewhere, though he’s familiar with Toal’s opinion and doesn’t disagree with it. And he doesn’t think it’s easier to win a libel lawsuit in South Carolina than anywhere else. “If you’ve been libeled and you prove it then you will probably have a good case,” he said. “I wouldn’t take it unless it was that way.” In recent days, meanwhile, the Sun News ruling has been closely watched by reporters in the state. Among other things, the Court of Appeals justices examined Wren’s e-mails and correspondence with multiple sources to try to determine his state of mind as he approached his stories. That point wasn’t lost on Doug Pardue, a reporter for The Post and Courier and now a colleague of Wren’s. Pardue said he did not believe the recent ruling will have a chilling effect on investigative journalism, at least not at his paper. “However, it does highlight several cautions for journalists,” he told me. “The first is to exercise precision in word choice and sentence structure. The second is to exercise the same precision in emails and other communications, along with a little caution.” Ron Aiken, a reporter for The Nerve, a think tank-based investigative newsroom, drew a similar conclusion about the need for care and precision, given the scrutiny applied by the court–though there’s a big difference between careful and being cowed. “Reporters should be as fearless as ever in bringing light to matters of fraud, waste, abuse and corruption,” he said. “Every case, whether won or lost, is of immense use to those in the field. I trust the lesson here is to only strengthen journalism, not weaken it, in South Carolina.”", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Stocks fell broadly yesterday, dragging the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index to a close below 3,0 for the first time in a year as the double whammy of disappointing corporate earnings and political turmoil spooked investors. Computer-maker Hewlett-Packard provided the bad news du jour, following gloomy reports last week from such tech stalwarts as Dell. Palo Alto's HP yesterday reported a quarterly profit that fell short of Wall Street expectations, prompting a wide-ranging sell-off of technology stocks. The Nasdaq index fell 62.27 to 2,966.72, a 2 percent drop, after plunging earlier in the day as low as 2859.39. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 85. 70 to 10,517.25, a 1 percent decline. HP, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange, fell $5, or 13 percent, to $34.13. On Nasdaq, Sun Microsystems was a big loser, dropping $3.88 to $85.31. Analysts said a steady drumbeat of profit warnings from some of the new economy's mainstays is prompting investors to reconsider how much they are willing to pay for the shares of technology companies. \"We've had record-high valuations,\" said Luke Mazur, chief investment officer of Highmark Capital Management. Forecasts of slowing profit growth from top technology companies \"causes tremendous rethinking of what kind of multiples you put on the stocks.\" The Nasdaq index crossed the 3,0 barrion the way up on Nov. 3, 19, propelled by dot-com hysteria. A little more than four months later, the index hit its high of 5,048.62 but has careened downward since. \"It's hard to see it slingshot back to 5,0,\" said Michael Weiner, a managing director of Banc One Investment Advisors. \"It could be years before we see that level again.\" Although the Nasdaq has plummeted more than 41 percent from its high, some analysts say technology stocks may still not have reached bottom. Falling below 3,0 breached an important psychological barrier, potentially opening the way for additional losses. \"While the broad stock market is fairly valued, we think technology stocks are still overvalued by 5 to 10 percent,\" said Tom Loeb, chairman and chief executive of Mellon Capital Management. Shares of biotechnology companies took a notable beating yesterday after the investment newspaper Barron's published an article warning that prices of stocks in the sector can't be justified. Shares of Genentech, one of the industry's giants, fell $9.25 to $70.19, while the stocks of such smaller biotech companies as Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Xoma and Abgenix all dropped more than 15 percent. The deadlock over the election of a president added an unpredictable and potentially explosive element to the investment landscape. Since the election a week ago, the Nasdaq and Dow indexes have fallen 13.2 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. Still, the political situation's effect on the stock market is much less important than investor gloom about earnings, analysts said. The impact of politics is being felt most keenly in such sectors as pharmaceuticals, where the prospect of price controls under a Gore administration is pushing share prices down sharply. Although U.S. money managers generally aren't focusing on politics, the flow of foreign money into U.S. stocks has slowed during the past week. \"We talk to clients in Europe and they're befuddled,\" said Mazur. The U.S. electoral chaos \"gives them another impetus to sell.\" Meanwhile, stock markets oversees are also reeling. Bourses in London, Paris, Frankfurt and Tokyo all fell more than 1 percent yesterday, with technology shares leading the way down. \"Market leaders in Europe and Asia have been affected by the deflation of the Nasdaq bubble,\" said Steven Schoenfeld, head of international equity management at Barclays Global Investors. \"For U.S. investors, there are very few places to run for cover.\"", "label": "false"}

{"text": "More on: Israel Democratization Palestinian Territories Peacekeeping “If Abu Mazen replaces Arafat, the critical question will be whether [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon will continue to act unilaterally, insisting that he does not yet have a Palestinian partner for peace so that he can continue to deepen Israel’s hold on the West Bank, or enter into serious negotiations with a new Palestinian leadership,” Siegman says. “The answer to this question will depend on how seriously the United States will become engaged and insist that the new Palestinian leadership be helped by Israel and be given the credibility it needs to fight terror and to pursue a nonviolent approach to Palestinian goals.” Siegman, a Council senior fellow and director of the U.S./Middle East Project, was interviewed by Bernard Gwertzman, consulting editor for cfr.org, on November 9, 2004. Post-Arafat, what’s likely to happen in the short run in Palestinian politics? It is encouraging that in this period of transition, when everyone thought there would be instability and even violence and jockeying for power, there has been relative stability. The various factions have so far acted responsibly and have sought to maintain Palestinian unity. Also, there seems to have emerged a consensus about who will head the new interim leadership. It will be led by Abu Mazen [Mahmoud Abbas]. The young guard seems to have accepted the need during this time of transition to turn to respected leaders who have been identified with the PLO [Palestinian Liberation Organization] over the years. Abu Mazen is seen as the likely replacement for Arafat for several of the positions that he held: first and foremost, as head of the PLO, as the PLO to this day remains the highest source of authority for Palestinian governance. He is the most likely successor to Arafat in that position as head of the PLO, because he is currently the No. 2 in the PLO— he’s the head of the Executive Committee. He is also likely to be the replacement for Arafat as head of Fatah—the most important political party within the PLO and the Palestinian Authority [PA]. It is also likely that Abu Ala [Ahmed Qurei], who is now prime minister, will retain that position. The elected president designates the prime minister, who has to be confirmed by the Palestinian Legislative Council. There will be an election for a new president? Yes, there will have to be an election if the person who replaces Arafat is to have any legitimacy. The PA’s basic law requires elections. Abu Mazen cannot become president without a general election? No, he cannot. However, the head of Fatah is elected by the Fatah organization. There would be a vote within Fatah, but not a popular vote. The same thing is true of the position of head of the PLO, who would have to be elected by the PLO Central Committee. The president of the Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, must run in a general election. You’ve met Abu Mazen? Yes, I have a long relationship with him. What kind of person is he? He has a very unlikely personality for a politician. He is a very private person. He is shy and uncomfortable dealing with the public. In the past, when he had difficult confrontations with Arafat, he never turned to the public for support. Often, in these difficult situations, he would just disappear from public view, leaving the country for extended periods of time. In the summer of 2003, under great pressure, Arafat appointed Abu Mazen prime minister. The idea was that this would accelerate peace talks. What happened? Why did that fail? The international community had put great pressure on Arafat to relinquish certain powers he had concentrated in his own hands, some of which he exercised illegally. They pressured him to appoint a prime minister, which the PA’s basic law at the time did not provide for. Arafat resisted this pressure for the longest time, but finally yielded. Several days before Arafat was scheduled to announce the appointment of Abu Mazen, word leaked out he intended to appoint someone other than Abu Mazen— a prominent businessman named Munib Masri, who had no political experience and therefore would be more easily manipulated by Arafat than Abu Mazen would be. I received a call from European Union and United Nations representatives asking me to fly in to see Arafat to convince him not to do it. I was told by senior State Department officials that if Arafat did not appoint Abu Mazen, the U.S. would not proceed with the “road map” and the peace process, and would leave Arafat to Sharon’s tender mercies. I met with Arafat at the Mukata [his Ramallah compound] and conveyed this message to him, and also urged Masri to withdraw his name from consideration for the post, which he did. So Mazen was appointed. He lasted for four months. What happened? Secretary of State Colin Powell published an article in Foreign Affairs in which he wrote that Arafat was to blame for Abu Mazen’s failure, which led to his resignation within four months. That was a very partial and, to my mind, dishonest rendering of what happened. Everyone knew that Arafat would try to undermine any new prime minister who would seek to assume some of his powers. It was understood that Abu Mazen could stand up to Arafat only if Israel were to give him credibility with the Palestinian public by improving their miserable lives by easing the closings in the territories, gradually withdrawing the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], releasing Palestinian prisoners, and other such measures. Despite his promises to do these things, Sharon failed to deliver. And despite Bush’s promise to press Sharon to keep these promises, he also failed to deliver. Sharon gave Abu Mazen nothing. Ironically, the prisoners Sharon refused to release to help Abu Mazen, the man who publicly denounced Palestinian violence and terrorism, were released by him some months later to the Hezbollah terrorists. And the territorial withdrawals he refused to make to help strengthen Abu Mazen he subsequently announced he would make by withdrawing unilaterally from Gaza, but in a manner that strengthened Hamas. So Sharon may now get a second chance to get things right. If Abu Mazen replaces Arafat, the critical question will be whether Sharon will continue to act unilaterally, insisting that he does not yet have a Palestinian partner for peace so that he can continue to deepen Israel’s hold on the West Bank, or enter into serious negotiations with a new Palestinian leadership. The answer to this question will depend on how seriously the United States will become engaged and insist that the new Palestinian leadership be helped by Israel and be given the credibility it needs to fight terror and to pursue a nonviolent approach to Palestinian goals. How can the United States get involved? The United States cannot and should not get involved in the choice of the Palestinian leader. American and Israeli support for a particular candidate publicly can only undermine him. Let’s assume it’s done. What should the United States do? Should it send a ranking envoy over there? During the [U.S. presidential] campaign, the question of how a new administration would deal with the Middle East peace process came down to who would be appointed as special envoy. But the real issue is not the envoy but U.S. policy. Palestinians must know that the United States will support a process that requires the permanent status issues [between Israelis and Palestinians] be resolved in bilateral negotiations, and that pre-emptive measures will not be tolerated. The United States must make it clear that continued unilateralism on Israel’s part will make a peace process impossible and will undermine a moderate new Palestinian leadership. This new leadership must act to end violence and terrorism, but it will have no chance at succeeding at this if Israel does not end all further settlement activity immediately and take the necessary steps on the ground. Conditions for a resumption of negotiations must conform to the road map and not be arbitrarily set by Sharon. What this means concretely, among other things, is that all final status issues, including borders and the status of Jerusalem, cannot be taken off the table by Israel. U.S. policy must make it clear to Palestinians that there is indeed a non-violent alternative to terrorism for the achievement of their legitimate goals. As long as Arafat was in power, the question was whether there was a Palestinian partner for peace. If he is replaced by a Palestinian leadership that opposes violence, the question will become: is there an Israeli partner for peace, and what is the United States doing to make sure there is? Let’s talk a bit about Arafat. You’ve known him for how many years? I’ve known him for about 12 years now. Lately, he’s obviously been in some disrepute— he’s been blamed by former President Bill Clinton and former Mideast envoy Dennis Ross for the failure of the peace process. Others, like former Clinton aide Robert Malley, take the opposite view. Where do you stand? Robert Malley, who was present at [the July 20 peace talks at] Camp David, does not absolve Arafat, but he also assigns blame to [then-Israeli Prime Minister] Ehud Barak and to the United States. There are reasons why Arafat refused to deal with Barak’s proposals, which is not to say that he was justified in doing so. He bears a very large measure of responsibility for the failure of Camp David. He did not have to accept Barak’s proposal without change, but he should have said, “These proposals represent a major advance, we’ve come a long way, but we’re not there yet, and we have to negotiate about the remaining gaps.” By failing to do so, he missed a historic opportunity and did great damage to the Palestinian cause. But Arafat’s failure did not occur in a vacuum. When Barak ran for office, he promised to revive and conclude the peace process with the Palestinians, and that this would be his first order of business. But from the moment Barak took office, he put the peace process with the Palestinians on ice, and instead focused on negotiations with the Syrians. Not only that, but he permitted the expansion of settlements at a rate that exceeded settlement expansion under [former Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu. He also abrogated unilaterally the agreement reached between Israel and the Palestinians by Netanyahu and Sharon, who was foreign minister at the time, at the Wye River Conference of October 1998 that required Israel to redeploy the IDF from occupied territories that were to be transferred to the PA’s administrative control. As a consequence, Arafat’s popularity among Palestinians had dropped to its lowest point ever. It is at this point that Barak, whose government was beginning to fall apart, decided to ask President Clinton to bring Arafat to Camp David for peace talks in 20. Arafat, and the Palestinians generally, had completely lost trust in Barak, whom they considered to be even more hostile to their aspirations and less trustworthy than Netanyahu. Arafat tried to persuade Clinton that this was not the right time for a negotiation process that would entail Palestinian compromises and asked that the Camp David talks be postponed. But because Ehud Barak needed successful peace talks to survive as prime minister and President Clinton wanted a peace agreement to be his legacy before leaving office, Arafat was literally dragged to Camp David. You have said that Arafat has made two big mistakes. He made more than two mistakes. But these two had particularly damaging consequences. One is the Camp David failure that we discussed. The other one is rarely noted by analysts and commentators. After 9/11, when President Bush announced a global war against al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden and asked for allies in this war, one of the first to respond was Arafat. Most importantly, Arafat challenged bin Laden’s claim that he attacked the U.S. in support of the Palestinian cause. Arafat rejected that claim and noted that al Qaeda had never done anything to help the Palestinians. Because of the political difficulty Arab leaders had in responding to the president’s call—primarily because their support would have been portrayed by bin Laden as a betrayal of Palestinians—President Bush welcomed Arafat’s offer of support. It was an embrace that held out the possibility of an important shift in U.S. policy toward Arafat and the Palestinians. No one understood this better than Sharon, who uncharacteristically blasted President Bush and accused him of engineering another Munich. It was criticism that chilled the relationship Sharon had enjoyed with President Bush. Instead of taking advantage of this situation to obtain greater support from Washington, Arafat destroyed this historic opportunity by sanctioning the secret smuggling of arms on the cargo ship Karine A, which was discovered and captured by Israel [in January 2002]. He added insult to injury by lying about his role in arranging for this transport, and lost the friendship and support of President Bush. What are the chances for serious negotiations now? There is now the opportunity to begin with a more modest approach to a resumption of the peace process by dealing with the withdrawal from Gaza promised by Sharon. The withdrawal that Sharon intended to implement unilaterally can now be coordinated with a new Palestinian leadership. If successful, this can serve as a bridge to negotiations over the West Bank as well. How far apart is Sharon’s desire to keep most of the West Bank settlements from the position contained in the final offer the Clinton administration brought to the Palestinians? In other words, Israel is going to keep a certain amount of settlements, right? Sharon’s current insistence on using the Gaza withdrawal to hold on to much of the West Bank is totally inconsistent with the Clinton proposals. Sharon would have to make a major change in policy to enter negotiations that require essentially a return to the pre-1967 lines, except for an exchange of territories on both sides of the old border, to accommodate the large settlement blocks near that border that could accommodate 70 percent to 80 percent of the settlers. In principle, Palestinians agreed to such an arrangement at Camp David, but they insisted on a fair exchange of territory to compensate the land they would be yielding to Israel. The other big issue is, of course, the refugees, and here Palestinians will have to make a major concession by agreeing to the return of refugees to the new state of Palestine instead of to Israel. I believe that is a concession they are prepared to make within the context of a fair agreement that also deals with Jerusalem and territory.

{"text": "Former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, the last two Republican commanders in chief before Trump, just put out a strong joint statement on the violence that took place in Charlottesville over the weekend, condemning \"hatred in all its forms.\" \"America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all its forms,\" the statement reads. \"We are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with unalienable rights,\" they continued, referencing the Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson, who was famously a resident in Charlottesville, Virginia. The timing of the statement is interesting. After all, just yesterday President Donald Trump answered questions about the violence in Charlottesville during an infrastructure press conference where he defended the alt-right and equated neo-Nazis to leftist activist groups. \"What about the fact that [the alt-left] came charging with clubs in their hands swinging clubs? Do they have any problem?\" Trump said. \"You had a group on one side that was bad. You had a group on the other side that was also very violent.\" Instead of blaming both sides - like Trump has - the Bushes specifically call out racism and anti-Jewish sentiment. Those feelings were a feature among those rallying to keep Robert E. Lee's statue up in Charlottesville rather than those countering their protest. The Bushes and Trump might be from the same party, but they clearly view what happened in Charlottesville in very different - and moral - ways. Even other prominent GOPers, like Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Sen. Marco Rubio, put out their own statements calling out white supremacists. You can read the full, short statement below from the Bushes below: America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all its forms.

{"text": "The Supreme Court is supposed to be the most respected and trusted judicial body in the US. It hands down decisions that affect hundreds of millions of Americans. And it's not easy for a case to work up to the highest court, much less get a hearing. But what if the Supreme Court's decisions were occasionally based on a totally made-up statistic? A new essay and paper by Ira Ellman, a law professor at Arizona State University, suggests that happened not once, but twice, in two major decisions regarding sex offenders — McKune v. Lile and Smith v. Doe. In 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that Kansas hadn't violated a prison inmate's Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination by forcing him to fill out a form for a treatment program for sex offenders. A year later, the court allowed Alaska to retroactively place sex offenders in a public sex offender registry. Justice Anthony Kennedy cited the same claim in justifying these decisions: a statistic that suggested the recidivism rate of sex offenders was as high as 80 percent. In both cases, the figure was supposed to show that extraordinary measures against sex offenders were justified to protect the public from a group of people who were very likely to reoffend. But Ellman found the statistic was essentially fabricated. The Supreme Court first cited a 1988 \"Practitioner's Manual\" for its decision, and the manual cited just one source — an article from Psychology Today — that claimed, \"Most untreated sex offenders released from prison go on to commit more offenses–indeed, as many as 80% do.\" But there was little to nothing to support the assertion, Ellman found: That sentence is a bare assertion with no supporting reference. Nor did its author have the scientific credentials needed too qualify at trial as an expert on recidivism. He was a counselor, not a scholar, and the article containing the sentence isn't about recidivism statistics. It's about a counseling program for sex offenders he then ran in an Oregon prison. His unsupported assertion about the recidivism rate for untreated sex offenders was offered to contrast with his equally unsupported assertion about the lower recidivism rate for those who complete his program. In fact, other research on sex offenders shows they're actually less likely to commit any felony after release than other ex-inmates. Even sex offenders deemed \"high-risk\" aren't 80 percent likely to reoffend, according to Ellman's review of a recent meta-analysis by Karl Hanson, which combined data from 21 studies that followed nearly 8,0 offenders: Nearly 20% of the high-risk offenders committed a new sex offense within five years of release, and an additional 12% did so during the next 10 years. But the 68% who hadn't committed a new sex offense fifteen years after release rarely did later. Indeed, none of the high-risk offenders who were offense-free after 16 years committed a sex offense thereafter. Those reoffending rates — 20 percent over five years and 32 percent over 15 years — are still, in my view, quite bad. But they're a far cry from the 80 percent cited by the Supreme Court in its decisions. Yet the rulings have been used to justify putting thousands of people in sex offender registries, as lower courts cited the same statistic over and over to allow states to place sex offenders on public registries and government supervision — sometimes for life. Jishai A lot of Americans might look at this Supreme Court flub and shrug, wondering why anyone should care about sex offenders' problems. It's an understandable position if you imagine most registered sex offenders to be violent, dangerous criminals who rape, sexually abuse, and sexually assault others. But according to Ellman, that's not the case: Sex offender registries include a lot of people who are low-risk from the outset: a teenager who had consensual sex with another teenager, people who possessed erotic images of anyone under 18 but never even attempted to commit any contact offense, and even, depending on the state, someone convicted of public urination. A Justice Department study found that more than a quarter of all sex offenders were minors at the time of their offense. People may assume the registry's purpose is to warn people about those who committed violent, coercive, or exploitative contact sex offenses, but they're in fact filled up with people who never did any of those things. There are some dangerous, violent people in states' sex offender registries. But sometimes that's not the case. Yet those nonviolent offenders who are unlikely to reoffend are just as hurt by the Supreme Court's decision, based on a totally made-up statistic, as anyone else on the registries.", "label": "true"}
{"text": "September is back-to-school month, a time of excitement and anxiety for many adolescents, who wonder if they are ready to meet the challenges of the coming academic year. It’s the same for students all across the globe. Claudine Umulisa is one of them. She was accepted into the Evening &amp; Weekend Program at the Akilah Institute, an all-women’s college based in Kigali, Rwanda. Claudine works by day as a sample maker at an employee-owned company called Abahizi Dushyigikirane Ltd, or ADC. Global fashion brand Kate Spade &amp; Company assisted with the formation of ADC, which makes a line of handbags marketed under Kate Spade’s \"on purpose\" label. More on: Gender Women and Economic Growth Education Sub-Saharan Africa Prior to joining ADC, Claudine owned a small jewelry shop in Kigali where she struggled to source materials and find customers. She plans to study information technology at Akilah, where she’ll gain skills in high demand at ADC and in the broader workforce across Africa. Claudine is lucky to have a job, but not because they’re scarce. According to a McKinsey &amp; Company report, Africa’s rapidly growing economy is projected to create between 54 million and 72 million new wage-paying jobs by 2020. The problem is a serious talent gap on the continent. Nearly half of East African employers in a 2014 survey cited a lack of skills as the major reason they did not fill vacancies. Additionally, employers found that up to 63 percent of graduates from East African universities were “lacking job market skills.” The simple truth is that secondary and higher education institutions in the region are not preparing their graduates for the workforce. Graduates in Africa will spend an average of five years searching for a job. And African women are particularly underserved when it comes to both secondary and higher education. Across sub-Saharan Africa, 75 percent of girls start school, but only 8 percent finish, and even fewer go on to the tertiary level. Only 64 women for every 100 men are enrolled in tertiary education. Pressure to marry early and have children explains part of this, but women face other barriers, as well: lack of female role models and opportunity, less access to financial services, entrenched patriarchy and restrictive norms, poverty, conflict, and epidemics. Initiatives to transform girls’ education – Let Girls Learn, Girls CHARGE, and the UN’s Millennium and Sustainable Development Goals – are focused on getting and keeping girls in school, and understandably so. Education plays a major role in the advancement of women. We know that educated women are less likely to marry early, less likely to contract , and that each year of school boosts an African woman’s wages by 10 to 20 percent. Research from the World Bank positively correlates women’s education with per capita growth. But is education alone sufficient to change the status quo for women and girls around the world? Amartya Sen, winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economic Science, didn’t think so. He was among the first to tout the benefits of women’s economic participation in his seminal work on gender inequality, Development as Freedom. The solution to gender disparities, Sen argued, could be found in women’s education, yes, but also in their ownership rights and employment. Together they enable women to become empowered and independent; to have a life of their own choosing. Income-producing women reinvest up to 90 percentof their earnings in their families, compared with 30 to 40 percent for men. They have healthier children, with higher immunization rates and greater nutrition. Their daughters tend to stay in school longer, marry later, contribute higher wages, and have fewer of their own children. Sen concludes that “women are increasingly seen, by men as well as women, as active agents of change: the dynamic promoters of social transformations that can alter the lives of both women and men.” Yet programs designed to educate women, and men, and connect them to the workforce are few. WISER in Kenya and the Global Livingston Institute in Uganda are two alongside the Akilah Institute in Rwanda. Akilah provides competency-based education programs linked to high-growth sectors and prepares graduates for careers and leadership roles. Based on a recent evaluation, 89 percent of alumnae secure and retain employment within one year of graduation and earn 12 to13 times the national median per capita income; 58 percent have received at least one promotion salary increase since graduating; and 90 percent support at least one other family member financially, including paying for healthcare or school fees for siblings. More on: Gender Women and Economic Growth Education Sub-Saharan Africa The program works because Akilah starts with and listens to employers, engaging them in defining needed skills and competencies. Leadership and soft skills, such as critical thinking, self-confidence, and teamwork, combined with market-relevant academic and career navigation skills ensure that students graduate career ready. Based on its new business and financial model, Akilah plans to open eight campuses across the region and serve more than 1 million students by 2031 so they can contribute to economic growth in their communities and countries. What happens when women and girls do manage to complete their education but have to spend five years searching for a job, when they have next to nothing to show for it other than raised expectations, theirs and their parents’, of a different life? It does little to address thesystemic barriers to girls’ education and economic participation. Africa urgently needs effective education-to-workforce programs to connect women, and men, with the labor market, in order to capitalize on the tremendous untapped potential of its young people. Claudine Umulisa is truly one of the lucky ones. She has a job and an opportunity to further her education. Unfortunately she is still an anomaly among African women, who need both skills and income to fully participate in the 21st century. U.S. State Department downgrades Office of Global Women’s IssuesA letter sentby Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations articulated the Trump administration’s plan to shutter, downgrade, and reorganize certain functional offices, special envoy positions, and ambassadorships within the State Department, including the Office of Global Women’s Issues, which will no longer report directly to the Secretary of State. Instead, the office—which advances the rights of women and girls through U.S. foreign policy—will be subsumed within the Under Secretariat for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights. The announcement comes after more than forty business leaders representing major American companies—including Accenture, Aetna Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson, Macy’s Inc., Xerox—authored a letter to administration officials highlighting the critical importance of the office and urging the administration to fill the Ambassador-at-Large role, which has been vacant since January. Tunisia reforms family lawsLast week, Tunisia’s government issued an ambitious new proposal to reform the country’s laws on marriage and inheritance. The revision would allow Muslim women to pursue interfaith marriages, a practice that is already permissible for men. It also would replace current inheritance laws—which limit women’s allotment to half of what men receive—with a gender-neutral scheme. Tunisia has long been hailed as a regional model for reforms to promote women’s rights, and Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi has expressed his intention to maintain progress for women under his administration. While some critics have claimed that the proposed reforms would not adhere to Islamic law, a number of Islamic scholars in Tunisia voiced their support for Essebsi’s proposals. More on: Gender Child Marriage Women and Women's Rights U.S. Foreign Policy Child marriage rises in South SudanNew reports suggest that rates of child marriage are increasing in war-torn South Sudan, now in its fourth year of civil conflict. Although child marriage is a long-standing practice in the country, United Nations agencies and the South Sudanese government say that conflict-driven mass migration, poverty, and food insecurity have increased prevalence of this practice. In the past year, the rate of child marriage has risen well above 60 percent in South Sudan’s most unstable states. Research also suggests that South Sudan’s marriage economy is linked to insecurity: skyrocketing bride prices, with higher prices paid for younger girls, are reportedly driving men to engage in cattle rustling and attacks on villages in order to gather enough cows to afford to marry. More on: Gender Child Marriage Women and Women's Rights U.S. Foreign Policy More on: Afghanistan Women and Women's Rights Development This post is co-authored by Becky Allen, a research associate in the Women and Foreign Policy programat the Council on Foreign Relations. On paper, the law is clear: men and women enjoy equal property rights under Afghanistan's 2004 constitution. But on-the-ground reality says otherwise as a combination of tradition and customary laws keep most Afghan women unaware of their land rights and far from owning property. As the Afghan Ministry of Justice estimates, 90 percent of Afghans decide land rights according to customary laws – regulations developed and instituted at the regional and tribal level. For this reason, few Afghan women are able to capitalize on their right to inherit and own property. While customary law varies throughout the country, it typically pressures a woman to relinquish her share of an inheritance to her brothers in order to ensure her social protection in case of divorce; demonstrate family loyalty; and avoid discrimination and shame at the hands of her community. The cultural expectation is that a woman's husband will become her economic provider and therefore she does not need her own land in her name. According to this view, it simply makes more economic sense for a woman to leave her share of land to her brothers, who will use it to provide for their families while her own husband looks after her. But this tradition ignores the good that comes from putting land in the hands of women. For one, with women's entrepreneurship on the rise in Afghanistan, land could act as collateral for women who need credit to grow their businesses – and in the process create jobs and boost their family's income. Second, owning land could help women working in agriculture increase their production rates by 20 to 30 percent, contributing to improved food security throughout the country. And third, land ownership by women has been linked to reduced violence against women, with some experts estimating that a woman who owns land is up to eight times less likely to experience domestic violence, a scourge found all across Afghanistan and affecting nearly nine out of ten women. With evidence of the benefits of women's land ownership clear, the question is: how can the U.S. and Afghan governments, along with multilateral organizations, put laws on the books into action when the law is so often left in the hands of local tribal leaders? USAID tried to tackle this question with the Land Reform in Afghanistan (LARA) project, which ran from 2011 to 2014. The initiative established a Women’s Land Rights Task Force comprised of prominent Afghan men and women as well as civil society to advise project leaders on land rights affecting Afghan women. The project proposed strategies for bolstering women's land rights, but it is unclear how much women's access to their land has changed since. The U.S. Institute of Peace recommends addressing women's land rights within an Islamic law framework, especially given that the Quran and Hadith permit women to both own and inherit property. As such, including local religious leaders in awareness raising campaigns and educational programming on women's land rights could boost buy-in from communities. What is clear is that Afghan women face much more work ahead. As the most recent Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey noted, only 17 percent of Afghan women independently own a house, compared with approximately 50 percent of Afghan men. This issue is often seen as secondary to the conflict in the country and to the overall plight of Afghan women. But getting land rights right could help to address both the nation's stability and its prosperity. For all its citizens. More on: Afghanistan Women and Women's Rights Development Central American countries outlaw child marriageEl Salvador and Guatemala passed legislation last week to prohibit child marriage, closing previously existing loopholes for cases of parental consent or pregnancy. The two countries rank among those with the highest rates of child marriage in the region: According to UNICEF, one-quarter of all girls are married by age eighteen in El Salvador, largely a product of the country’s family code, which previously permitted child marriage in cases of pregnancy. In Guatemala, nearly one in every three girls are married by age eighteen, with rates especially high among the country’s indigenous Mayan communities. El Salvador and Guatemala now join a number of other nations—across all regions of the world—that have taken steps to prohibit child marriage in recent months. Women’s political participation grows in KenyaThis month’s elections in Kenya resulted in a record number of women taking office: voters elected three female governors and twenty-three female parliamentarians, a 30 percent increase over the number of women chosen in the country’s last election cycle in 2013. In addition, more women than men registered to vote in 21 of Kenya’s 47 counties. And for the first time in history, a woman of ethnic Somali descent won office, which experts hail as a significant development in a government that has long been marked by politics of tribe and patronage. While Kenya’s constitution requires that one-third of parliamentary seats are reserved for women, the government has been slow to implement this rule in years past, making the recent increase in women’s political participation a watershed for the country. More on: Gender Politics and Government Women's Political Leadership Child Marriage UN launches compact to prevent sexual violenceUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres took a historically unprecedented step toward preventing sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers and personnel around the world, asking all governments to sign a compact pledging to end such violations. Reports of abuse of civilians—particularly women and girls—under the protection of UN missions have grown in recent years, with unpunished incidents of alleged sexual violence drawing international attention. All countries have been given a deadline of August 25 to sign the compact or provide explanation for refusal to sign. While the compact is voluntary and bears no power of enforcement, it is a notable step to address a highly critical 2015 assessment of UN peacekeeping operations, which recommended significant reform within the UN to address all forms of conflict-related sexual violence. More on: Gender Politics and Government Women's Political Leadership Child Marriage More on: Egypt Women and Economic Growth Economics Development This post is co-authored by Becky Allen, a research associate in the Women and Foreign Policy programat the Council on Foreign Relations. The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) recently launched an initiative that will dedicate approximately $1.6 billion to fund the country's microfinance industry. The new program is part of CBE's broader financial inclusion strategy, which seeks to put new financial tools in the hands of those who are unbanked or underserved – especially women and young people. In Egypt, 52 percent of the population is under age twenty-five and 86 percent of people live without access to quality financial services, including savings accounts, insurance, and credit. But micro-finance — proven to be an effective tool in reaching some of the world's poorest — is just the start. And focusing exclusively on the microfinance sector leaves out a critical segment of the global population: the \"missing middle.\" The \"missing middle\"is made up of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing nations. Despite serving as the primary drivers of job creation and economic growth in emerging markets and developed economies alike, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that 55 to 68 percent of formal SMEs in developing markets lack adequate financing, amounting to a combined credit gap of approximately $1 trillion. Women business-owners, in particular, face challenges in accessing capital. Constrained by legal and cultural barriers, as many as 70 percent of women-owned SMEs in developing countries report having to go without the financial tools they need to grow their businesses. In Egypt, where women own 30 percent of businesses, the credit gap among women-owned SMEs stands at $283 million. Not only does filling this gap represent a substantial market opportunity for banks, it also holds the potential for significant job creation in a country where the official unemployment rate is 12 percent – roughly double the global average. Among young people ages fifteen to twenty-nine, the unemployment rate is estimated to climb even higher at 33 percent, or 79 percent of the total unemployed. While microfinance programs have proven a boon to women – benefitting millions of women around the world through small-dollar loans used to cover household expenses and to create businesses – many microenterprises fail to become formal, employment-generating SMEs due to lack of larger, sustained credit options, a shortage of skills, and insufficient networks. Meanwhile, larger-sized financing mechanisms – particularly bank-funded small business loans, but also venture capital and private equity – target larger firms with promises of higher returns than the average SME can generate. In effect, this creates a \"missing middle\"and leaves both jobs and dollars on the table. Egypt's banking sector clearly recognizes the importance of financial inclusion to the nation's economic future. Indeed, the theme of the Egyptian Banking Institute’s (EBI) ninth annual conference, hosted in early May, was Promoting Financial Inclusion in the Banking Sector. The program featured discussions on the importance of bringing more people into the banking system to boost GDP growth and poverty reduction, as well as the best paths and practices to advance financial inclusion, particularly for youth, women, and micro-, small-, and medium enterprises. As Egypt continues to flesh out its strategy for bringing all its citizens into the banking system, its economy could benefit from paying particular attention to that last group – small- and medium-sized businesses — the \"missing middle.\" One idea is for the CBE to consider a parallel program to its newly launched microfinance initiative – this one focused on SMEs, especially those run by women. Such a program could be accompanied by training for women on business skills and how to best utilize financial services to grow their businesses. Sex-disaggregated data collection also could help to determine the financial products that would be most beneficial to female SME owners. Banks in Egypt could also partner with multilateral organizations such as the International Finance Corporation (ICF), which is already active in SME financing. For example, mirroring the work of the IFC in neighboring Jordan, Egyptian banks could work with the IFC to establish distinct financial products and branding for the women’s SME market. One example of this in Jordan is the Shorouq brand of financial services for women at the Bank al Etihad, which targets women by providing collateral-free loans and special savings programs. Likewise, it could look to the work of the IFC in Pakistan, where bank staff are now offered incentives for opening accounts for women. Egypt could take this initiative one step further and offer incentives to staff that work with women-owned SMEs on credit and other financing options. Currently, Egypt has one of the lowest levels of financial inclusion, not only in its region, but across the globe. While the country has taken steps toward arming more and more people with bank accounts and other financial services – strengthening the regulatory environment and placing a greater focus on mobile banking – significant portions of the population will remain unbanked if the \"missing middle\"continues to be an overlooked part of creating value and generating prosperity for the nation's economy. More on: Egypt Women and Economic Growth Economics Development Pakistani Taliban recruits womenThe Pakistani Taliban accelerated its recruitment of women this month, launching a new women’s magazine to encourage potential female recruits to join. The publication targets a young, social media-savvy audience, inviting women to organize and learn how to use weapons and grenades. Experts suggest that the launch of the magazine is a strategic move to re-establish influence among young people in the wake of recent losses on the battlefield. The Pakistani Taliban joins other extremist groups by targeting women for recruitment: women have conducted numerous suicide attacks for Boko Haram and the self-proclaimed Islamic State group—including last month in Mosul, in what may be the largest case in history of women carrying out suicide operations in battle. Colombia combats human traffickingThe Bogota government launched a new initiative this week to combat human trafficking by increasing awareness about the prevalence of the crime in the capital. With an estimated 308,200 people trapped in slavery today, Colombia is home to the second-highest rate of human trafficking in Latin America, second only to Mexico. Experts suggest that these figures may climb following the peace deal signed with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) last year, given concerns that post-conflict displacement will elevate the risk of human trafficking. Studies from Bosnia to Guatemala show that the crime of trafficking—including forced sex work and labor exploitation—skyrockets in countries that have recently experienced war. More on: Gender Women and Women's Rights Forced marriage in KyrgyzstanA new report from researchers at Duke University finds that one in five women in Kyrgyzstan are kidnapped for marriage. The practice, called ala kachuu, is especially common among the ethnic Kyrgyz, among whom one-third of all marriages are the result of abduction. In many cases, kidnappers rape victims as a shaming tactic to deter them from fleeing to their families. The women forced into such marriages face a heightened risk of domestic violence with few legal protections or recourse, given that these unions are not recognized under national law. Kidnapped brides also are more likely to bear children suffering from low birthweight, an indicator of poor health for both mother and child. While forced marriage is illegal in Kyrgyzstan, and the country has taken some steps to combat this harmful practice, rights groups suggest that a wide gulf remains between the laws on the books and their implementation in practice.

{"text": "US House and Senate Democrats in July introduced the most expansive LGBTQ civil rights bill ever. And on Tuesday, President Barack Obama announced he supported it. The Equality Act would effectively expand the Civil Rights Act, originally passed in 1964, to protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace, housing, public accommodations (hotels, stores, and similar public places), education, and various other settings. It also expands public accommodations protections to prohibit sex discrimination, and strengthens other, existing protections in public accommodations. But the proposal faces tough odds in a Republican-dominated Congress, which has shown no interest in bills that would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in the workplace and education - much less a more comprehensive bill that includes LGBTQ protections in practically all settings covered by federal law. Federal and most state laws don't explicitly protect LGBTQ people from discrimination. According to the Human Rights Campaign, most states don't include sexual orientation and gender identity in existing civil rights statutes that generally ban discrimination in the workplace, housing, and public accommodations, and 37 states don't include both in laws that ban discrimination in education. Most states don't ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace, housing, or public accommodations. As a result, more than half of LGBTQ Americans, according to the LGBTQ advocacy group Movement Advancement Project, live in a state where, under state law, an employer can legally fire someone because he's gay, a landlord can legally evict someone because she's lesbian, and a hotel manager can legally deny service to someone who's transgender - for no reason other than the person's sexual orientation or gender identity. Currently, 19 states ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, while three additional states ban discrimination based on sexual orientation. Some other states protect public but not private employees from discrimination. Many municipalities have nondiscrimination laws that only apply within their local borders, even in states that don't have such laws. And some companies prohibit discrimination in their own policies. The protections can further vary from state to state. Massachusetts's protections for gender identity and Utah's protections for sexual orientation and gender identity don't apply to public accommodations. Some states also include exemptions for discrimination based on religious grounds. Enforcement varies, as well: Depending on the state, private lawsuits, fines, and jail time are all possible forms of punishment for discrimination. Other civil right laws also protect students from harassment and discrimination in K-12 public schools - but these are typically separate from measures that ban discrimination in the workplace, housing, and public accommodations. Thirteen states have education laws that ban discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, while Wisconsin protects students from discrimination based on sexual orientation but not gender identity. So in a majority of states, LGBTQ students have no explicit legal protections in schools. President Lyndon Johnson signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964. PhotoQuest via Getty Images Nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people build on existing federal and state laws - most notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act, which protect people from discrimination based on their race, color, national origin, religion, and sex. \"The whole point was to say that black people ought to be able to drive to Mississippi from New York and have a place to stay, or get a meal at a restaurant,\" Robin Wilson of the University of Illinois said of the landmark federal laws. \"Over time, we added protected classes to that - people with disabilities in some states, for example.\" Some LGBTQ advocates argue that legal prohibitions against sex discrimination already protect LGBTQ people. But that interpretation hasn't been affirmed by higher courts, casting uncertainty over whether it would hold up in a legal dispute. The uncertainty is why advocates want explicit legal protections for LGBTQ people: New state or federal laws that add sexual orientation and gender identity to nondiscrimination protections would remove any doubt about the reach of laws like the Civil Rights Act, Fair Housing Act, Title IX, and state statutes that prohibit sex discrimination in their public accommodations protections. (Federal public accommodations laws don't currently shield against sex discrimination - only discrimination based on race, color, national origin, and religion.) \"There's no substitute for being explicitly listed in the law,\" Ian Thompson, LGBTQ legislative director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said. \"I also think it's a very powerful statement to see that it is the law of the land that discrimination against individuals because of their sexual orientation or gender identity is wrong and illegal.\" Shutterstock The research on nondiscrimination protections is limited, but a 2013 series of studies by Laura Barron of the US Air Force Management Policy Division and Michelle Hebl of Rice University found laws that ban workplace discrimination appear to decrease discrimination based on sexual orientation. Researchers conducted three studies. The first looked at awareness of civil rights laws. The second looked at discrimination toward gay or lesbian job applicants in neighboring cities with and without nondiscrimination protections. And the third placed people in mock interviews to see whether they were less likely to discriminate against a gay or lesbian applicant if they thought local laws banned it. Across the board, the studies found nondiscrimination laws reduce signs of prejudice. People in places with existing nondiscrimination laws were more likely to be aware of the protections, and they were less likely to discriminate. Among the 229 participants in the mock interviews, those who believed a local law prohibited discrimination were also less likely to discriminate, based on metrics that gauged negativity toward gay and lesbian people. The reason civil rights laws are effective, Barron and Hebl suggested, isn't necessarily that people fear the punishment of the law - but rather that civil rights laws authoritatively set the morals of a community. \"[T]hese effects occur because anti-discrimination legislation can create social norms that govern what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviors to display toward stigmatized individuals,\" the researchers wrote. While Barron and Hebl's studies may be the best research to date, it has some gaps. The researchers only looked at workplace discrimination, not housing or public accommodations, and sexual orientation, not gender identity. The authors also didn't look at the effect of punishments attached to nondiscrimination laws - for example, whether tougher fines or the threat of jail time could further reduce discrimination. Surveys show that most Americans widely support nondiscrimination protections, but a major hurdle to getting the laws passed may be that Americans already think they're in place. In a 2014 poll from YouGov and the Huffington Post, 62 percent of respondents said it was already illegal under federal law to fire someone for being gay or lesbian, 14 percent said it was legal, and 25 percent weren't sure. The same poll found most Americans - 76 percent - said it should be illegal to fire someone for being gay or lesbian, while just 12 percent said it should be legal. The YouGov and Huffington Post poll isn't the first to find strong support for civil rights protections for LGBTQ people. A 2014 survey commissioned by HRC, an LGBTQ advocacy group, found 63 percent of US voters favored a federal law that protects LGBTQ people from employment discrimination, while just 25 percent opposed it. Another poll from Reuters, conducted in April 2015, found 54 percent of Americans said it's wrong for businesses to refuse service to people based on religious beliefs, while 28 percent said businesses should have that right - suggesting that most Americans would disapprove of businesses discriminating against LGBTQ people on such grounds. For LGBTQ advocates, the overall results present a tricky situation: Most Americans support nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people, but they don't appear to know that these protections aren't currently explicit under the law. \"When people already think these protections are in place,\" Thompson of the ACLU said, \"it can be difficult to work up the motivation that's necessary to push for them.\"", "label": "true"}

FALSE Example: [Collected via email, September 2015] Is this true? Muslims demands Munich end ‘anti-Islamic’ Oktoberfest? Origins: On 11 September 2015, a petition was started on the web site Change.org, ostensibly by (and on behalf of) Muslims, requesting that the city of Munich, Germany, cancel its upcoming Oktoberfest celebration because the event is “anti-Islamic”: Dear City council of Munich, I am writing this letter to bring to your attention something that I and many Muslims believe is unfair and requires attention. I would like to inform you that the Oktoberfest is an Intolerant and Anti-Islamic event. We tried to ignore the event, but there too many Un-Islamic acts done at the Oktoberfest. Such as alcohol consumption, public nudity etc. We understand that the Oktoberfest is a yearly German tradition, but we, Muslims, can not tolerate this Un-Islamic event, because it offends us and all Muslims on the earth. We are requesting the immediate cancellation of the upcoming Oktoberfest event. We also believe that the Oktoberfest might also offend all the Muslim refugees coming from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan. The cancellation of the Oktoberfest event will help refugees not to forget their Islamic history. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Morad Almuradi While the petition was “real” in the sense that someone actually posted it to Change.org, it was not written by “Muslim refugees” in Germany as implied by some publications. The author of the petition, Morad Almuradi, listed his location as The Netherlands: The intentions of the author were also unclear, but even if the petition were written in earnest, it would represent one person’s opinion and not that of all Muslim refugees. Additionally, the viewpoint expressed by the petition appears to be a minority opinion, as the petition has only managed to muster a few hundred signatures, and the majority of those appear to have come from people who signed in order to add hateful comments: Those comments lead us to believe that this petition may was created by an Internet troll in order to foment outrage. The fact that this petition was posted on 11 September, a day on which items critical of Islam tend to reach fever pitch, supports this hypothesis. It should also be noted that anyone can start a petition on Change.org for any reason. The web site is currently hosting petitions asking Beyonce to make another Destiny’s Child album, for President Obama to allow a high school student to have a party after homecoming, and for WaWa to bring back roast beef sandwiches. Just because something appears on Change.org doesn’t mean that it was written in earnest, that it represents a majority opinion, or that it should be taken seriously.

The first is a fascinating new paper by Andrew Cheon, Maureen Lackner, and Johannes Urpelainen of Columbia University in Comparative Political Studies. (If someone wants to point me to an ungated working paper version, I’d be happy to link there. UPDATE: Ungated working paper version here.) They look at the relationship between oil and gasoline prices between 2002 and 2009 for 175 countries. Higher oil prices should lead to higher gasoline prices; anything that works against that connection is a sign of a subsidy. Not surprisingly, they find that on average, changes in the price of oil have a big impact on gasoline prices. What’s extraordinary is how much that link is undermined in countries that have national oil companies (NOCs). The numbers depend on how exactly the analysis is done, but typically, having an NOC cuts the impact of higher oil prices on domestic gasoline prices in half. The authors show that this phenomenon cuts across oil exporting countries (such as Saudi Arabia) and oil importing countries (such as Argentina). They theorize that having an NOC makes it easier to put and keep subsidies in place both because governments have political influence over NOC behavior and because NOC budgets can often be structured to hide costs. The authors then distinguish among different types of NOCs in order to push those theoretical ideas further. Again the results are intriguing. Countries with NOCs whose chairs are appointed by the government – and hence more amenable to being used as instruments of policy – are more likely to have large fuel subsidies. Countries with NOCs that set their budgets autonomously – and hence are less likely to be able to hide the costs of subsidies – are far less likely to have large fuel subsidies. All of this should be useful insight to international policymakers deciding where to aim their efforts to promote fossil fuel subsidy reform: in addition to focusing on the largest and most distorting subsidies, they would do well to concentrate on countries that either lack NOCs or have relatively independent ones. My colleague Isobel Coleman has a new memo out proposing a new arrow that they should include in their quiver as they target those opportunities. Subsidy reform is politically difficult. International efforts to promote subsidy reform have aimed to persuade elites that it would nonetheless be wise. Isobel’s memo argues that this needs to be supplemented with financial and technical assistance aimed at persuading publics to get behind beneficial reforms. Her proposed Global Subsidy Elimination Campaign would be housed at the World Bank and pursued in partnership with private players. In addition to supporting public campaigns, it would also bolster technical help for countries struggling to design acceptable reform strategies. One might be skeptical that a PR effort can move the needle much. (After all, if it were a useful thing, wouldn’t governments be doing it themselves already?) Isobel points out, though, that such a campaign needn’t do all that much in order to more than pay for itself. One hundred million dollars a year could yield a twofold return on investment if it cut world subsidies by a mere 0.04 percent. That doesn’t even include the external benefits that would come from reduced fuel consumption. Fossil fuel subsidies have proven remarkably difficult to reduce. It’s exciting to see new insights into where it might be most possible to reform them, and ways that such reforms might be effectively pursued. With all luck there will be more of this – and more on-the-ground successes – to come. More on: International Organizations More on: Iran Fossil Fuels Treaties and Agreements Ask someone to identify a big geopolitical consequence of the ongoing U.S. oil production boom and odds are high that they’ll invoke Iran. (Every one of the links in that last sentence is an example.) Without surging U.S. oil production, they’ll argue, sanctions on Iranian oil exports would have led to a massive oil price spike. Here is a concrete case of the oil boom yielding greater U.S. freedom of action in the world, and a harbinger, it would seem, of things to come. The historical account seems right, but it’s tough to see how the Iran experience might be repeated. The upshot is that the lessons for future U.S. freedom of action –and for geopolitics more generally –are being badlyover-read. To understand how the U.S. oil supply boom helped make room for Iran sanctions, think about the impact of the supply boom first, and the sanctions second. How would the oil boom have affected the market around 2012 – the year that the oil export sanctions started to really hit Iran – had there been no curtailment of Iranian exports? In principle, rising U.S. output might have deterred others’ investment in oil production. But the gap between the emergence of the U.S. oil boom and the imposition of Iran sanctions was too short to allow any such shifts to meaningfully affect actual production. (Remember this for later.) Only two responses to accommodating rising U.S. supplies would have existed. First, prices could have fallen, encouraging greater oil demand and (at some point) shutting in some other supplies. Second, some oil producers (notably Saudi Arabia) could have voluntarily curtailed their production, bolstering prices but increasing spare capacity in the market. The actual outcome would certainly have been a mix. Now bring the Iran sanctions back in. To the extent that higher U.S. production would have otherwise encouraged greater spare capacity, this spare capacity could in turn have been used to blunt the impact of lower Iranian exports. To the extent that U.S. production would have otherwise encouraged lower prices, any actual price impact of the Iran sanctions (due to inability to fully offset lower exports through others’ spare capacity) would have happen against a lower base price, yielding a lower absolute price. And, to the extent that other commercial projects had been shut in, some would have come back online in the face of falling Iranian exports, partly offsetting the reduced supplies. Indeed this is basically what happened – except instead of occurring in a 1-2 sequence, so that analysts could easily disentangle the two dynamics, everything happened at the same time. New spare capacity didn’t emerge because it was being used up to cover Iranian shortfalls just as it was, in effect, being created. Lower prices didn’t emerge because, just as U.S. production was pushing prices down, lower Iranian exports were offsetting that impact. This is why, when people say that the U.S. oil boom created room for Iran sanctions, they’re basically correct. This same logic, though, can help us understand why this experience doesn’t tell us much about the future. Recall from a few paragraphs back: The upshot was that adjustments had to occur through spare capacity or large price shifts instead. But this constraint vanishes when you look out over the longer term. At this point, higher U.S. production ought to be affecting investment decisions around the world, and more important, before long that in turn ought to be affecting actual production. Much of the impact of higher U.S. production on world prices might be neutralized by reduced oil supply investment, and hence production, elsewhere. This means that net downward pressure on prices should be greatly reduced. To be certain, there should be some net addition to supplies, and hence somewhat lower prices, which would help accommodate future sanctions. But, over the medium to long run, the effect on prices should much more muted than it is in the short term. Even more important, the boom shouldn’t boost spare capacity in the system over the long haul. Imagine, for example, that Saudi Arabia expects U.S. production to be so high that it anticipates having to curtail its own production in order to maintain high prices. In the short run, the only way it can do that is by boosting spare capacity. In the longer run, though, it can reduce investment in production. Doing that would yield the same oil revenues at lower cost and with the same amount of spare capacity that Saudi Arabia originally desired. (Since spare capacity is ultimately a political tool, the amount of it Saudi Arabia actually wants shouldn’t change with rising U.S. oil production.) The one thing that doesn’t leave the world with, though, is an increased ability to deal with new shocks – and, as a corollary, it doesn’t leave the United States with new freedom of action. The only way around this is if U.S. supply growth continues to surprise to the upside. In that case, the world will generally be oversupplied, resulting in lower prices, higher spare capacity, and greater U.S. freedom of action to do things like Iran sanctions. It’s essential to be clear, though, that this requires more than merely high and rising U.S. production – it requires high and rising U.S. production well beyond what market participants currently anticipate. Given the frenzy over U.S. oil production, that’s a high bar to meet. Indeed it seems at least as plausible, given all the current excitement, that surprises will be on the downside. In that case, we should expect the opposite of what happened around the Iran sanctions – higher prices, less spare capacity, and reduced U.S. freedom of action. You won’t see me betting either way– including on the idea that a new worldof easier-to-use energy sanctions is upon us. More on: Iran Fossil Fuels Treaties and Agreements More on: China Fossil Fuels The energy world has been abuzz this week with news that the Department of Commerce will allow exports of minimally processed condensate. This has been heralded as a “ step towards a rational oil policy” and a shift that “ could change the world’s energy balance”. In particular, many are speculating that this is a step toward complete elimination of the ban on crude oil exports. Meanwhile, far more quietly, BP and CNOOC announced a twenty billion dollar deal (last week) to trade liquefied natural gas (LNG). That agreement, I’d hazard, is at least as important as the U.S. move. But first the oil export news. The ban on U.S. oil exports matters: it could ultimately push down U.S. oil prices substantially and deter (otherwise) economically attractive production as a result. It’s also liable to be an irritant in U.S. trade relations with other countries, particularly because U.S. policy may be unacceptable under the WTO. This week’s news, though, says relatively little about whether the ban will be lifted. The Department of Commerce appears to have approved exports of condensate – essentially ultra-light oil – if the condensate has been processed through a distillation tower. Many politically informed market observers have long expected that the administration will ultimately allow condensate exports without any processing at all. There has never seemed to be much administration enthusiasm for the oil export ban on policy grounds; this isn’t like the gas export ban, where there are legitimate questions about impacts on consumers and on some manufacturers that stirred up internal debate. My sense is that the big question has long been political: does the administration (and potentially Congress) believe that the political price of actually lifting the oil export ban is worth paying? In that context, any low profile move that effectively relaxes the ban or confirms a loose interpretation of it – including the announcement this week – should look attractive to policymakers. Most important, this week’s move says little about the political appetite for a big move on the ban – and hence provides little insight into what its ultimate fate will be. If there’s one interesting wrinkle, it may be the timing – the administration’s willingness to do this now, rather than after the elections, implies some willingness to take political risk. On the other hand, given the amount of confusion surrounding the decision, it’s probably unwise to infer too much finely-tuned strategy behind the move. Heck, I wouldn’t be surprised if a Department of Commerce bureaucrat made this decision without any meaningful White House involvement. Meanwhile interesting things are happening in Asia with the announcement. News reports indicate that “BP will likely source much of the LNG [that it will sell to China] from its U.S. export plant at Freeport, Texas”. This follows little-noticed news last year that BG (not BP) would sell CNOOC natural gas priced according to a formula based in part on U.S. (i.e. Henry Hub) prices – an arrangement that, at a minimum, only makes sense financially for BG given its stake in U.S. LNG exports. In this case, one can’t find any public speculation about links to actual physical U.S. volumes (as opposed to U.S. prices). But when I was in China last month, I was stunned to hear an industry insider describe the deal straightforwardly as China buying U.S. natural gas. Why is this important? No Chinese company has applied directly to export U.S. LNG or has even done a direct contract with an operator of a U.S. LNG export facility. Part of this is a desire to avoid regulatory headaches. But some analysts (myself included) have suspected that Chinese companies aren’t particularly eager to depend on U.S. natural gas supplies. These two deals now make something of a pattern, and suggest that China (or at least some Chinese companies) may be more comfortable depending on the United States than might plausibly have been the case. At a time where distrust between the two countries is high, this matters. It’s important, of course, not to infer too much. If I could look at the BP and BG contracts I’d immediately focus on one thing: What are the sellers’ obligations if U.S. supplies are physically interrupted by the U.S. government? One possibility is that BP and BG would be off the hook for delivering the contracted gas, and the Chinese buyers would be sent scrambling for alternatives. If that’s the case, then the Chinese companies really are depending on the continued flow of gas from the United States to Asia, and on U.S. policymakers’ decisions. The other possibility, though, is that the contracts put the burden on BP and BG: in this case, faced with an interruption of U.S. supplies, the companies would be required to make up the shortfall using gas sourced from elsewhere. If this is the case, then CNOOC isn’t really becoming meaningfully dependent on the United States (and on U.S. policy) – they’re just getting a nice financial deal. I tend to think that these sorts of political developments in the shape of gas trade will ultimately be more important than ones in oil. Oil markets are already highly flexible; while bad U.S. decisions could erode that at the margin, it’s going to be tough to really reverse the decades-long trend in that direction. Gas markets, in contrast, remain much more rigid, balkanized, and political. Developments that change this over the next decade or so therefore have the potential to do considerably more. More on: China Fossil Fuels More on: Climate Change The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the EPA will announce carbon regulations for existing power plants on Monday that seek to reduce U.S. electricity sector emissions by 25 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 and by 30 percent by 2030. It’s illuminating to compare those figures with EIA estimates of the likely impact of other policies that have been proposed. The table below summarizes several; the year in parentheses is when the estimates were made. The reduction figures are for the power sector only to make them directly comparable with the new EPA proposal. Any comparison among these should be made carefully – these are very different sorts of regulatory schemes. But three things jump out: The 2020 target is relatively deep. It entails lower emissions than the EIA projected would be achieved by the Clean Energy Standard Act of 2012, the American Power Act of 2010 (better known as Kerry-Lieberman), or the ill-fated Waxman-Markey bill of 2009. The 2020 target also looks relatively easy to achieve. It is consistent with what the EIA estimates would be accomplished with a modest $10 a ton carbon tax starting in 2015 and rising to $13 by 2020. Waxman-Markey, by contrast, envisioned a much-higher carbon price of $32 a ton by 2020. (Relatedly, it also envisioned substantial use of carbon offsets. Those can’t meaningfully be attributed to any sector, so there’s no useful way to fold them into this comparison. The figures for the cap-and-trade schemes in the table are actual projected sectoral emissions reductions, not regulatory targets.) How could Waxman-Markey have resulted in higher emissions despite having a higher carbon price? Both business-as-usual emissions and the cost of reducing emissions were higher in 2009 than they are today. The 2030 target is not nearly as aggressive as the 2020 target. The reported target for 2030 is barely more stringent than the 2020 goal. It is less than the EIA projects could be achieved with a $10 a ton tax together with abundant gas. It is far less than the EIA projected would result from a higher tax or Waxman-Markey. It is similar to what the EIA projected for Kerry-Lieberman; my guess is that’s because Kerry-Lieberman’s cost containment provisions were projected to kick in before 2030. This points to what might be the most important take-away here. The new EPA rules are almost certainly the last major stab at cutting emissions by 2020. But it is better to think of the 2030 goal as a current target that might be ratcheted down in the future. This could happen through new legislation or new regulation under existing law. The year 2030 is still far away. More on: Climate Change More on: China Climate Change Pollution “I’ve been working my whole life on climate change. And now, because of policies to fight local air pollution, Chinese carbon emissions will peak and begin to decline in less than ten years, and our efforts on climate change will have nothing to do with it.” That was the message from one of several Chinese scholars, businesspeople, NGO staff, and officials I met over the last week in Beijing and Shanghai. One focus of my discussions was China’s massive air pollution problem: How, I asked people from a range of backgrounds, would China clean up the mess? The answer matters to non-Chinese observers not only because of its consequences for Chinese political stability but because China’s choices could have a big impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. Install scrubbers on coal-fired power plants to cut local air pollution and you do nothing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. (You actually increase them a nudge.) Ditto if you simply move polluting industries away from the big cities. Switch to lower-carbon energy, though, and you get a twofer: reduced local air pollution and lower carbon emissions too. So I was heartened – and quite frankly surprised – to hear so consistently that people expect switching from coal to gas (along with penetration of zero-carbon energy) to not only be at the core of the Chinese strategy to reduce local air pollution (not really news) but to actually be fairly successful. What’s the reasoning behind this? The big Chinese air pollution problem has to do with fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5. A lot of that comes from coal-fired power plants that could, in principle, have their emissions scrubbed. But it has been challenging to get companies to turn on their scrubbers even when it’s been possible to get them installed. And much of the coal use comes from heavy industry, where scrubbing emissions isn’t an option. That leaves two other choices: switch heavy industry from coal to gas or move it inland. (A third option – shut it down – is already being employed in some cases where there’s overcapacity and the politics are manageable.) Moving industry can entail political and economic problems; in particular, without adequate infrastructure, it can become unmanageably expensive to move industrial products from inland to places where they’re used. Nonetheless, industry will often move. So I was encouraged to hear optimism that even relocated industry would become more efficient, and often switch fuels, at least partly cleaning up. This all leaves one very large question: where will China get its gas from? Some will be imported – news last week that China and Russia have signed a massive gas supply deal may be at best mixed news from a geopolitical perspective, but it augurs well for climate change. In particular, it suggests that Chinese wariness about energy security is increasingly being outweighed by worries about air pollution, a theme that I also heard frequently. (Of course, there were other factors driving the China-Russia deal too.) Other gas will be domestic. The massive unknown here is how much of this domestic gas will be conventional or shale gas and how much will be synthetic gas (\"syngas\") produced from coal. The first two are good for climate change; syngas, in contrast, is not. Alas, on that last question, the people I talked to were all over the map, with estimates of anywhere from one to one-hundred billion cubic meters a year of syngas in the next decade. That – along with the more basic question of how well China is able to execute on its strategy – will determine how much Chinese efforts to combat air pollution translate into leverage on climate change. I’m not ready yet to place my bet alongside the climate researcher who now believes that Chinese carbon emissions will peak as a byproduct of efforts to fight local air pollution. But the fact that such a prospect can even be taken seriously is welcome news. More on: China Climate Change Pollution More on: China A couple weeks ago the World Bank reported that the Chinese economy would pass the U.S. one by the end of this year. This led to rather breathless headlines from normally more sober observers ( FT: China poised to pass US as world’s leading economic power this year). In an op-ed yesterday in the international New York Times, I argue that GDP is an awful measure of economic power, and explain why Chinese economic power is often less (though sometimes more) than meets the eye. The op-ed is broad, but I’d like to think that its themes should help us think more intelligently about energy and climate. In particular, the piece draws in part on thinking that developed while I was working on my recent book B y All Means Necessary: How China’s Resource Quest is Changing the World with my colleague Liz Economy. The latest headlines about China compare its economy to the U.S. one using purchasing power parity. Yet when Chinese companies compete for resources abroad, whether through trade or investment, it’s transparently clear that what matters is Chinese wealth measured in international market terms. No one in Nigeria or Canada cares how much the money China offers for their resources can buy in Beijing. The other big thing I learned while working on the book was how difficult it can be for Beijing to mobilize the country’s economic assets, even including state-owned firms that superficially would appear easy to control and direct. The reality is that just because Chinese entities might give the state power in principle doesn’t mean that they give it similar power in practice. One might draw a loose analogy to the United States: the U.S. government can occasionally harness the attraction of U.S. energy to geopolitical ends (for example by conditioning foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms and mineral rights on the behavior of the acquiring companies), but that’s normally difficult. ( See U.S. natural gas exports and .) To be certain, this analogy is ripe for misinterpretation – the Chinese government often has much more influence over state owned companies than the U.S. government has over private American firms (though see implementation of environmental safeguards for a place where that’s typically not the case). But it’s useful nonetheless. I’m interested in any thoughts that readers have about the op-ed, and, in particular, about any other implications for energy and climate. Take a look here if you’re interested. More on: China", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Can a doctor be president? Ben Carson's trying to be our first. Polls have him tied with Donald Trump atop the Republican field. Carson's single best pitch for the job? That as a surgeon, he's uniquely qualified to make hard decisions. \"This is a big theme of Carson's presidential pitch: that neither the rigors of the campaign nor those of the White House can faze a man who held children's lives in his hands,\" Jim Rutenberg wrote in the New York Times, back in March. \"His life in brain surgery has prepared him for the presidency, [Carson] maintains, better than lives in politics have for his rivals.\" Of course, those rivals don't agree. \"Ben's a doctor, and he's not a dealmaker,\" Trump said on Face the Nation this week. Experts in surgery, leadership, and presidential history disagree with Carson, too. \"Nothing in the life of a surgeon prepares you for the complicated negotiating structure of the presidency,\" Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution told me. There's no question that of all the major candidates, Carson has the most proficiency in a technical skill. He spent four years in medical school, and another six years in residency. And to become a Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon isn't just a matter of tenure and persistence; you need true talents. \"Gifted hands,\" say. Regardless of what happens with Carson's presidential run, his life has already defied the odds. And his career has been important and meaningful: He's helped advance medicine, and saved thousands of lives. But while surgeons play God in the operating room, they're just as human as the rest of us. Many have problems managing their money or their tempers. The writer Malcolm Gladwell even says we overestimate the difficulty of surgery, and claims that with enough practice — and fine motor skills — nearly anyone who can drive a car can also be a heart surgeon. \"I have a very low opinion of the difficulty of cardiac surgery,\" Gladwell confessed in an interview last year. I think Gladwell goes too far. The best surgeons are incredibly driven and exceptionally smart, and it's no surprise that some have found success outside of the hospital. Heart surgeon Bill Frist became Senate majority leader. General surgeon Atul Gawande is arguably America's best health-care journalist. But Gladwell is right that sheer admiration for surgeons may blind us to the reality of the job. And Justin Dimick, a University of Michigan surgeon who runs a leadership development program, agrees that it's a mistake to ascribe certain skills to all surgeons. That's especially true for a rare quality like leadership. \"Does being a surgeon make you a better leader?\" Dimick mused in an interview. \"I haven't seen any evidence to suggest that.\" Dimick co-authored a recent study that found rising surgeon-leaders admitted to having gaps in key administrative skills, like setting a vision and getting others to follow them. This isn't surprising: Doctors go to school to be doctors. They don't go to school to learn management skills. \"Most physicians have major deficits in those leadership competencies by the time they're elevated to leadership positions,\" Dimick says. \"And that's why we developed our leadership program — to help them develop those competencies in an intentional way.\" And while Carson has held that surgery is the best preparation for national leadership, I couldn't find an expert who agrees with him. Instead, a half-dozen researchers kept returning to the same theme: It's very different to be a leader in the operating room, where a surgeon has total autonomy, than it is to be a leader in politics, business, or beyond. \"Some surgeons lead well within the OR, but once they leave that sphere of influence … they can often be horrible at leading others (and leading themselves, too),\" University of Alabama Birmingham scholar Christy Lemak said via email. \"For every surgeon who ends up succeeding in the boardroom,\" Dimick adds, \"there are probably an equal number of surgeons who haven't dealt with the stress well and ended up in anger management.\" Rather than focus on whether a doctor can be president, there's a different way to approach Carson's candidacy: by identifying the qualities of our nation's best presidents. Kamarck would know: She's a veteran of the Clinton White House, a Brookings Institution scholar, and the author of the forthcoming book Why Presidents Fail. \"Great presidents are great politicians,\" Kamarck told me. \"The presidency was designed by the Founding Fathers to not be an autocratic place.\" She ticked off a few examples of presidents who were able to navigate difficult politics and build consensus: Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton. Based on that rubric, I asked Kamarck who was best prepared among the Republican field. She named John Kasich — the Ohio governor who also served in Congress and ran the House Budget Committee. \"He's conducted the most complicated negotiations in the government, with Congress, and over the budget,\" Kamarck said. \"Kasich stands out from the crowd, in terms of the experiences [that] allow you to be a good president.\" Meanwhile, Carson's most prominent leadership experience outside of the hospital is serving on the boards of Kellogg and Costco. And that's why Kamarck's opinion on Carson was less optimistic. \"People who are not used to working in a world that requires negotiation will be frustrated\" by the presidency, Kamarck added. \"And brilliant doctors — wonderful as they are [for] opening up a heart — don't have to have a negotiation for what they do.\" Kamarck said we should think about choosing our president the way we think about choosing a doctor. \"If you needed brain surgery, wouldn't you want to go to somebody who knows how to do brain surgery?\" she added. \"You look at someone who knows how to do the actual job.\" Correction: A previous version of this article reported that Kasich was the former head of the Office of Management and Budget.

{"text": "French President Hollande endorses Macron after first round of election French President François Hollande endorsed independent candidate Emmanuel Macron after he won the most votes in the first round of France’s presidential election on Sunday. National Front leader Marine Le Pen placed second. François Fillon and Benoît Hamon, presidential candidates who did not advance to the second round, both asked their supporters to vote for Macron, BBC reported. Le Pen began campaigning Monday in the northern town of Rouvroy. While there, she said, “I’m on the ground to meet the French people to draw their attention to important subjects, including Islamist terrorism.” Macron said on Sunday that the “challenge is to break completely with the system which has been unable to find solutions to the problems of our country.” Macron served as economy minister during Hollande’s presidency before resigning to form his own political party “En Marche!” (On the Move!) last year. First-round election results Macron won 8.4 million votes, or 23.75 percent, and Le Pen won 7.6 million votes, or 21.53 percent, The Guardian reported. Republican Party candidate François Fillon came in third with 19.91 percent of the vote. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who leads the independent La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) party, placed fourth with 19.64 percent. Socialist Party candidate Benoît Hamon was fifth with 6.35 percent of the vote. The second round of the election, a runoff between Macron and Le Pen, is scheduled for May 7. France also has a parliamentary election scheduled for this June to elect representatives to its 577-seat legislature. Summary of the candidates’ platforms Macron, 39, has said he would invest 50 billion euros ($53 billion) in job-training, infrastructure and renewable energy projects. His platform also includes allowing companies more freedom to renegotiate the 35-hour work week and introducing corporate tax cuts, BBC reports. Macron describes his party as neither left nor right. Le Pen, 48, said she would keep the 35-hour work week, make the retirement age 60 years of age and prioritize French citizens for social housing. She has called for a referendum on France’s membership in the European Union. Le Pen also proposed a temporary ban on all immigration and a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year to 10,0. She also called for the expulsion of all illegal immigrants, according to BBC.

If it’s a choice between “fear” (i.e. Le Pen, according to The Washington Post) and “hope” (i.e. Macron), then it doesn’t leave much reason to vote for Le Pen, does it? This could promote prejudice against the National Front candidate. The First Round In The French Presidential Elections Marked A Political Earthquake Dramatizes: The fact is that no candidates from a “mainstream” party advance to the second round of voting. There are many ways to look at this, but a “political earthquake” is a little dramatic and suggests it’s not a good thing. Is that necessarily true? France election results deliver another blow to anti-EU populists (video) Opinion with little data: Given that Macron placed 2 percentage points higher than Le Pen in Sunday’s vote, it’s a bit of an exaggeration to call this a “blow” to Le Pen, especially since she’s still in the running for president.

{"text": "Another freedom has been taken away from him: Yesterday on the Christian Broadcasting Network, televangelist Pat Robertson aired a segment slamming President Obama for signing the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law. Extending hate crimes protection to the gay and transgendered community, Robertson argued, was a targeted attack on homophobic Christians like himself. Robertson said the new law is the latest example of a “noose” tightening around “the necks of Christians.” Apparently, Robertson’s definition of freedom is the ability to physically attack and injure gay and lesbian persons: Assuming that people who believe Pat Robertson have the capacity to read, here is the actual language from the statute that addresses “hate crimes” committed on the basis of sexual orientation (and other categories): Whoever . . .willfully causes bodily injury to any person or, through the use of fire, a firearm, a dangerous weapon, or an explosive or incendiary device, attempts to cause bodily injury to any person, because of the actual or perceived religion, national origin, gender,sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of any person. . .

So, in order to believe Robertson, one must also believe that Christians, by definition, want to “willfully” cause “bodily injury” to people in the listed categories.

I always welcome the opportunity to partner with my constituents“noted Senator Joel Anderson in his 2014 press release. The Senator further expressed that California Heroes month is dedicated to honoring those who help others. It is a magnificent opportunity for the residents of California to educate the public on the importance of selflessly giving and recognizing those local conventional, nonconventional, and unsung heroes within each community. This could be anyone from a teacher, firefighter, soldier, neighbor across the street, or even the young man or woman who helped their fellow citizen carry their groceries. It’s important we recognize every local hero for their efforts. These heroes and their good deeds inspire and encourage others to step up to help their neighbors in need. During September, there are several events taking place to honor those who give back in our community. Join over 50 football players, marching band members, cheerleaders, and their supporters at local high school football games as they honor local heroes, with designated half time activities and tribute games (check your local high school game schedules). You can also thank a hero and enjoy free food, at VSSN’s Salute to Heroes Appreciation Night, where California Pizza Kitchen, Lucille’s Smokehouse Barbeque, Panda Express, Red Robins, and more will provide free food and beverages (while supplies last). This event will also have live music to honor our educators, first responders, veterans, and military families on September 19th from 6:00-9:00 pm at Temecula Promenade Mall. This event is sponsored in part by Computer Training Academy and Citi Bank. Assemblywomen Melendez will host the 67th Assembly District Veterans Expo, and many more events are scheduled through communities all over California, check your local listings. You too can do something exciting, inspiring and celebratory like: sending appreciation letters to local teachers wishing them a great year, host a community clean up, hug a hero in your life, if you own a business give a special discount or free item to an educator, first responder, veteran, service member. Plan a community or small social event, volunteer at a local nonprofit, or within a church. Take action and share the great things that you did in a tweet, press release, snapchat, or any social media platform you think of. Remember every little thing counts. Take the challenge in September to be an Actioneer and thank a hero in celebration of California Heroes Month.

{"text": "[Below, Tom Knapp has some very good news. Please don’t let funding shortfalls knock us down just as we’re picking up some momentum. We are driven by your financial support. Please donate today. — Brad Spangler] Dear C4SS Supporters, After a brief “slump,” we seem to have worked the kinks out. We’re back into double digits for mainstream media “pickups” of C4SS commentaries this week! First, submissions: On the strength of content that’s “internationally submittable” — of global interest rather than parochial (with respect to any particular country, but the usual suspect is the United States) — I’ve made 11,3 discrete op-ed submissions to 2,834 publications this week. Next, “pickups.” So far this week, I’ve detected 12 of them on four continents: In my final media coordinator update of 2010, I noted that we were approaching 100 “mainstream pickups” at about the seven-month mark of actively submitting, and that I expected us to hit 200 by the end of our first year this coming June. If this coming week works out as well as the past one has, we’ll pass the 200 mark before my next update, and before the end of March. C4SS content also continues to show up in places that may not quite fit the “MSM” mold, but which are nonetheless valuable outlets. A few that come to mind this week: Libertarian Strategy Monthly, the Libertarian Alliance blog, Infoshop News, Gonzo Times and the Bastiat Institute. I’ll try to get back to mentioning (and linking) a few of these sites each week — if I missed you this time, I’ll be back around. Finally: If you like what we’re accomplishing at C4SS, please help us continue and expand on our efforts. With only a week to go on our current fundraiser — which we’re running to pay C4SS’s workers for work they’ve already done and which you can see some of the results of above — we’re at only 49% of our modest goal. Check out the top of the right sidebar on any page at c4ss.org for the “ChipIn” widget, and show us some love. Have a great weekend!

{"text": "The United Nations expresses its gratitude to the City of New York for hosting the Millennium Summit by spelling out “Thank You” in lights on its Secretariat Building on 10 and 11 September, 20. UN Schneider, UN Staff Photographer New York City: “Thank You NY” the United Nations building administration spelled out in lit-up windows of their beautiful 39 story headquarters years ago after their annual meeting of global big shots here. It is happening now again with the annual General Assembly in town. Every year it’s a strange time. The illuminated courtesy above is a thanks to New Yorkers for enduring the disruptions of nearly 200 heads of state, and now Hurricane Trump, in town. Midtown workers and residents grumble at the inconvenience of not being able to pursue their itineraries without the cops bossing them around, closing off streets and enforcing “frozen zones.” Stand on a corner and you might see a president or a king, a potentate or a dictator. Or maybe just some twat with a motorcade. The boutiques on Madison Avenue are filled with first ladies shopping for baubles on their national treasury’s dime, and it’s a fair bet you can’t find an available hooker in the tri-state area as their husbands pursue “intercultural understanding meetings.” *cough* If you’re ever in New York, a little known but fabulous diversion is the $22 guided tour of the UN Headquarters situated on 42nd St and the East River. The site used to be a slaughterhouse, and many other locations (Bronx, Westchester, Switzerland, Nairobi) were considered, but the genius of architects Le Corbusier and Niemeyer combined with Manhattan’s political gravity to build it on the East Side. There are grand statues in the ample gardens, heaps of flags, and a sense of reverence peculiar to places of great human importance. It’s like Jerusalem, the Vatican or Mecca except helpful to humanity. Upstairs, if you know people who will let you visit, many of the corridors are still painted “UN Blue” and there’s a last century feel to the whole behemoth: until a decade or so ago you could still smoke cigarettes in the offices. This and other John Le Carre type jurisdictional oddities are due to the fact the entire complex is an enormous embassy and its own country, legally speaking. Many of the employees have diplomatic immunity, don’t pay any American taxes and aren’t subject to local laws. Over the decades we’re read of diplomats indulging in various felonies; hundreds of thousands in unpaid parking fines (looking at you Russia), and even an African diplomat who kept a slave in his penthouse. It should be said, though, most responsible non-Russian countries do obey the laws here. This goes for our enemies as well as friends, but it gets strange. Dictators who would otherwise be arrested in the US (Yasser Arafat, Castro and Gadaffi, staying in his stupid tent) when visiting the UN or representing there are given special diplomatic visas. Diplomats of our enemies like Iran, Cuba, or North Korea can work and reside only within a 100 mile radius of the UN building. It is not called a “short leash visa for villains” – but it’d be fun if it were. The real hard currency for the hundred plus heads of state infesting Manhattan now isn’t the meetings, or listening to rambling speeches of politicians through tinny translation ear-pieces at the Secretariat: it’s the show for their home audiences. This week is a chance, at their respective governments’ expense, to take a trip to America with their spouse(s), idiot relatives, cronies and hangers on in their own fancy planes. So many foreign “Air Force Ones” they have to park them outside NYC airports and their motorcades have run into each other at times. They shop and appear on the world stage, can meet with discrete Panamanian bankers, shady arms dealers, and get at least a walk on part in a Big Production for the proles at home on telly. But even considering all the above amusements, and its imperfect nature, the UN is a force for good. Its vaccination, clean water, education, peace keeping and refugee efforts make the world a better place. Right wing fevers about “global government” are, for a lawyer with any understanding of the dynamics, laughable: no UN policy is effected without the consent of the signatory country-parties involved, and all its treaties must be ratified by signatory member states. The UN owns no black helicopters. The main problem is many of its agreements and resolutions are ignored: Israel still builds illegal settlements like Lego, North Korea still nukes away loudly, and even our own county’s compliance with resolutions is sketchy. An unbiased observer and international peacemaker is especially precious in this current Orwellian era where America’s Forever Wars have continued for 16 years and looks like being a multi-generational adventure. Plus, all the money and attention are great for our city! So in response to their building-sized light-up of windows spelling “Thank You NY” — New York replies: “You’re Welcome.”", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Strategic Culture Foundation Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan – a self-styled neo-Ottoman sultan – was only a few years a darling of Western governments and media, proclaimed as a moderniser of Turkey, overseeing a bustling economy and positioning his country as a strategic bridge to Asia. But Erdogan’s involvement in the US-led regime-change project in Syria is now steadily revealing his family’s appreciable criminal enterprises: from smuggling oil and stolen artefacts, to gun-running for terrorist networks. The former Sultan of Swing is swinging alright, but it could be at the end of anincriminating rope whose noose is becoming ever tighter around his neck. Russia’s air strikes in support of the Syrian government in its nearly five-year war against foreign-backed mercenary brigades are blowing the lid on thecorruption at the heart of the Turkish ruling AK Party, and the Erdoganfamily business in particular. One factor in why Erdogan ordered the fatal shoot-down of a Russian Su-24 fighter jet this week was out of revenge for how Russia is destroying theTurkish ruler’s criminal schemes. The destruction of hundreds of oil tankers and other facilities commandeered by the jihadist terror network in eastern Syria and western Iraq is hitting Erdogan’s lucrative racket. The smuggling routes – estimated to earn $1 million per day for the terror brigades – are integrated by Erdogan’s son, Bilal, whose licensed shipping companies traffic the illicit goods to global markets. Russian intelligence has laid bare this smuggling empire, as presented by President Vladimir Putin at the recent G20 summit held in Turkey’s Antalya. Further incriminatingdetails are expected in coming weeks. This week, following the downing of the Russian warplane, Erdogan boldly dismissed the oil connections as «slander». But as Putin retorted, with a touch of sarcasm, it’s hard to imagine how the Ankara authorities could be unaware of an illicit industry involving thousands of oil-laden trucks criss-crossing the heavily militarised Turk border. Among the contraband are believed to be precious artefacts stolen from Syria’s ancient dwellings, such as the cities of Palmyra and Iraq’s Nimrod,according to the Syrian information minister, Omran al-Zoubi. These artefacts dating from 2,0 years ago are designated as world heritagevaluables by the United Nations. It says something about the dubious values of Erdogan and his AK Party cronies when world heritage objects are being looted to finance personal gain and terrorism. The trade in oil stolen from Syrian and Iraqi state-owned facilities by thejihadists is only one half of a giant cross-border loop tied up by Turkey. Convoys of trucks laden with weapons are going back into Syria from Turkey on an almost daily basis. Those weapons, paid for by proceeds from the oil smuggling, are then distributed among the plethora of jihadist terror groups, including the Al Qaeda-linked Al Nusra and so-called Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh). The arms trade is overseen by Turkey’sNational Intelligence Organisation (MIT), headed up by Hakan Fidan, who is closely associated with Erdogan and the AKP leadership. Fidan was quoted by the state-run Anadolu news agency last month asoffering an apologia for the IS terror group. «ISIS is a reality and we have to accept that we cannot eradicate a well-organised and popular establishment such as the Islamic State», said Fidan, who added: «Therefore I urge myWestern colleagues to revise their mindset about Islamic political currents… and thwart Vladimir Putin’s plans to crush Syrian Islamist revolutionaries [terrorists]». The statement caused such a controversy that the Anadolu news agency later issued a denial of its prior publication. Despite a heavy media crackdown under Erdogan, sections of the Turkishmedia have courageously carried damning reports on the oil-weapons nexus that is fuelling the war in Syria. This week, the editor of the Cumhuriyet newspaper, Can Dundar, was arrested on charges of «spying» and crimes against the state because he published articles with photographic evidenceexposing the massive cross-border weapons dealing, overseen by Turk Intelligence. Erdogan has threatened the editor with a life sentence for daring to reveal «state secrets». Another Turk newspaper, Today’s Zaman, also this week reported on anunintended slip made by Adana state prosecutor, Ali Dogan, a protégé ofErdogan. The prosecutor inadvertently revealed in a statement that up to 2,0 trucks filled with arms and operated by Turk intelligence have beenferrying firepower to militants in Syria. It thus makes the claims made by the Syrian minister al-Zoubi that thedowning of the Russian Su-24 this week – resulting in the death of its pilot – was an act of revenge by Erdogan owing to the severe damage that Russia’s military intervention in Syria is inflicting. That damage includes not only huge financial losses to Erdogan and his family entourage, but also to theentire war effort for regime change against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In an interview with Russian media, the Syrian minister said: «All of the oil was delivered to a company that belongs to the son of Recep [Tayyip]Erdogan. This is why Turkey became anxious when Russia began delivering airstrikes against the IS [Islamic State] infrastructure and destroyed more than 500 trucks with oil already. This really got on Erdogan and hiscompany’s nerves. They’re importing not only oil, but wheat and historicartefacts as well», added al-Zoubi. If Erdogan thought he could poke the Russian bear in the eye and get away with it, he is sorely mistaken. Russia has stepped up its bombing campaign along the Syria-Turkey border, hitting oil trucks heading north and thereverse-flow of arms trucks heading south. In the Syrian border town of Azaz, a Russian air strike this week reportedly destroyed up to 20 vehicles believed to be stocked with weapons. Seven people were killed in the air raid. Ankara claims that the convoys crossing the border are carrying«humanitarian aid» to Turkmen Syrians. Turk Prime Minister AhmetDavutoglu has complained that Russian air strikes have been targetingTurkmen «brothers and sisters» – inferring civilians. But these are the same Turkmen militia who gained notoriety this week by brutally murdering the Russian pilot who parachuted from the Su-24 downed by Turk F-16s jets. The Turkmen militia, with names like the 10th Brigade of the Coast, arefighting hand-in-hand alongside the other jihadist terror groups, Al Nusra and IS, to topple the government in Damascus. The Turkmen, who reside in northern Syria but who are ethnically related to Turkish people, have played an instrumental role in waging Erdogan’s covert war of terror in Syria. Last year, in April 2014, Turkmen militia carried out a massacre in thenorthern coastal village of Kessab, in Latakia Province, where 88 Armenian Christians were slaughtered. Thirteen of the victims were beheaded,according to survivors. That attack also involved brigades from al Nusra, IS and the so-called Free Syrian Army, the alleged «moderate secular rebels» much championed by the Western governments and media. (A follow-upcolumn will be published on that specific massacre in the coming days.) Significantly, a Turkmen commander recently protested bitterly to theErdogan regime over it not suppling his fighters with enough weapons. Turkmen commander Ömer Abdullah of the Sultan Abdülhamit Brigade was quoted as saying: «We are trying to survive under unbearable brutality and we need Turkey’s help.» He was referring to Russian air strikes, adding: «Every day our Turkmen brothers are dying. We expect the [Erdogan] government to support us. Why have they abandoned us? Our martyrs fall every day. Why are we being left alone? I don’t understand». As Turkey’s Today’s Zaman points out, the Turkmen’s claim of not receiving sufficient weapons raises the bigger question about the arms trucks that Turk intelligence, MIT, has been running into Syria. Where have the machine-guns, artillery and mortars contained in thousands of cross-border convoys gone to? If the Turkmen brigades are being cut out of the supply chain then that suggests that Ankara’s weapons are being funnelled instead to the other jihadist groups, such as Al Nusra and IS. Russia’s military intervention in Syria is turning the tide decisively against the criminal US-led war for regime change, by decimating the ranks for terror brigades that Washington and its allies have deployed for that objective. For Turkey’s self-styled strongman Erdogan, Russia’s intervention is also hammering home huge personal losses. His egotistical schemes ofresurrecting Turkey as a new Ottoman regional power are being shattered. The international reputation of the country under his leadership is sinking into a putrid sewer. Moreover, his family’s criminal involvement in the conflict is also beingexposed. And his responsibility for fuelling a criminal war of aggression with the loss of over 250,0 lives looms ahead of Erdogan like a noose. TheSultan of Swing indeed.

{"text": "Ted Cruz is trying to ruin your beloved childhood memories again. First, he fucked up The Simpsons, and now he’s coming after Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry’s Kennedy Administration in Space fantasia. In Cruz’s mental version of the show, Captain James T. Kirk is a Republican (or will be, in a few centuries), and Jean-Luc Picard, that tea-drinking squish, is a Democrat. This only stands to reason: Cruz has also decided that, were he alive today, JFK himself would be a Republican, too. Because, you know, tax cuts. In an interview with Wonkette O.G. Ana Marie Cox in the New York Times Magazine published Thursday, Cruz outs himself as a Trekkie — but as a fairly clueless one, so far as Trek’s worldview goes. As we said when he proclaimed his love for The Simpsons (and flubbed his two “favorite” quotes from the show): Popular culture is hard for conservatives. So much of it is filled with liberal bias, and yet they still keep glomming on to shows like The Simpsons, which openly ridicules them, or Star Trek, in which starship crews chosen by an affirmative action office zip around a post-nationalist, post-scarcity, socialist utopia spreading science and rationalism, never going to church on Sundays, and pretty much ignoring America’s Judeo-Christian heritage (the last line in TOS’s “Bread and Circuses” notwithstanding). This is not to say that Cruz is completely wrong about his thoughts on the differences between the original series (TOS for you non-nerds … are any Wonkette readers not nerds?), which ran from 1966 to 1969, and Star Trek: The Next Generation, aka TNG (1987-94). After saying that he unequivocally preferred Kirk over Picard (conventional wisdom, perhaps, but also potential fightin’ words at some conventions), he offered his Deep Thoughts on the two Starfleet captains: Let me do a little psychoanalysis. If you look at ‘‘Star Trek: The Next Generation,’’ it basically split James T. Kirk into two people. Picard was Kirk’s rational side, and William Riker was his passionate side. I prefer a complete captain. To be effective, you need both heart and mind. Gee, you’d almost think he’d have mentioned “The Enemy Within,”the gloriously cheesy episode where a transporter accident literally splits Kirk into two guys, one logical and compassionate, the other emotional and violent. Not quite the duo, but It’s Been Done, and Cruz’s little moral about needing both heart and mind is virtually taken from the episode. (Or maybe he did mention it and Cox left it out;it’s a tightly edited interview, and her Nerd Alert warnings may have been going off.) Cox also says, “I thought your critique might go in a different direction, because ‘Next Generation’ is more touchy-feely in its politics than the original,” which is true enough, although our Inner Comic Book Guy keeps adding “Especially in the first two seasons.” Cruz’s reply is both simplistic and wrong: No doubt. The original ‘‘Star Trek’’ was grittier. Kirk is working class; Picard is an aristocrat. Kirk is a passionate fighter for justice; Picard is a cerebral philosopher. The original “Star Trek” pressed for racial equality, which was one of its best characteristics, but it did so without sermonizing. Buh-wha? No sermonizing? This is where we know that you, Ted Cruz, are No True Trekkie. Both series relentlessly sermonized, and if anything, TOS was far more heavy-handed about it, on everything from the Cold War (the Vietnam fable “A Private Little War”) to the anti-racist moralizing of “Let That Be Your Last Battlefield,” the most laughably preachy episode — from today’s perspective at least — in the franchise’s history. “Last Battlefield” featured a centuries-long conflict between Lokai and Bele, the last two survivors of the their planet’s race war, with some collateral damage to the Enterprise inflicted by Frank Gorshin’s scenery-chewing as Commissioner Bele, the representative of his planet’s ruling caste: Nope, no sermonizing there. You’re a maroon, Cruz. Now, to be fair, Next Generation‘s similar fable on gay rights, “The Outcast,” just might have exceeded “Last Battlefield” in ham-fisted allegory. But James T. Kirk, a Republican? Forget it. He’s a Cold War liberal, much more of a Robert McNamara than a Donald Rumsfeld. Yes, a nice American imperialist man of action, but the Star Trek of the ’60s and the Next Generation of the ’80s and ’90s are both a reflection of their creator, Gene Roddenberry, who went from reluctant Cold Warrior to “let’s resolve this peaceably” after seeing what happens when a cowboy is allowed too much free rein on the bridge. And the Federation is not a galaxy of capitalist competition; it’s a squishy western European post-scarcity socialist state, where nobody worries about money (except those loony Ferengi in TNG) and everyone cooperates. You won’t find a priest in the bunch, except on the primitive planets where religion is a sham to control the people, and anyone kicking off his campaign for head of the Federation at a religious university — with mandatory attendance! — would be quickly exposed as a charlatan. Oh, and both captains of the Enterprise — Kirk on the original and Picard on the Enterprise-D — respected science, and would never have ignored a threat like global warming. Ted Cruz, you’re no Captain Kirk. Now, you might very well be a Harcourt Fenton Mudd … [ NYT via MSNBC]", "label": "true"}
{"text": "More on: Europe and Eurasia Monetary Policy International Organizations United States Security Alliances IMF Chief Economist Olivier Blanchard has said that Greece needs to slash pension spending by 1% of GDP in order to reach its new budget targets. The Greek government continues to resist, arguing that Greeks dependent on pensions have already suffered enough. But it has yet to put a compelling alternative to its creditors. What depresses us is how little attention has been paid to one major area of Greek government spending that seems ripe for the ax: defense spending. Greece spends a whopping 2.2% of GDP on defense, more than any NATO member-state save the United States and France. Bringing Greece into line with the NATO average would alone achieve ¾ of what the IMF is demanding through pension cuts. Greece has long argued that its defense posture is grounded in a supposed threat from Turkey – also a big spender on things military. But surely the United States and the major western European powers can keep a cold peace between NATO allies at much lower cost. So why don’t they? German and French arms-export interests surely explain the silence on the creditor side: Greece is one of their biggest customers.

Instead, it will “bundle” the payments due to the Fund over the course of June into one payment of about €1.7 billion that it will make at the end of the month. This contradicts earlier pledges that it would not resort to bundling. The only country ever to have done so is Zambia, three decades ago. While the dramatic move suggests that Athens is seriously contemplating outright default, we think such a move, at this point, borders on insanity. This is because the gap between the parties over the main issue between them, the size of the primary budget surplus (the excess of revenues over expenditures, excluding interest payments) Greece will have to achieve in the coming years is now very small relative to what it was a year ago - as shown in the figure above. In contrast, the cost of a Greek default is likely to be a complete cut-off in ECB liquidity support that will crush the Greek banking system and, also likely, force the country out of the Eurozone. Then again, Greece has always had an affinity for tragedies.

This could be long-lasting and important. Prior to the crisis, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) set a target for the so-called federal funds rate, the interest rate at which depository institutions lend balances to each other overnight. The New York Fed would then conduct open market operations – buying and selling securities – in order to nudge that rate towards the target. It did this by affecting the supply of banks’ reserve balances at the Fed, which go up when they sell securities to the Fed and down when they buy them. The Fed kept the level of reserves in the system low enough that some banks needed to borrow from others in order to meet their requirements, thereby ensuring that the fed funds rate was always an important one. The cost of borrowing through other means then tended to move up and down with the fed funds rate, thus giving the Fed effective power over the cost of short-term credit broadly. During the crisis, the Fed’s Quantitative Easing programs – large-scale purchases of assets from the banks – drove up the volume of excess reserves, or reserves beyond those banks are required to hold, to unprecedented levels. A consequence of this is that many institutions can fulfill their reserve requirements without needing to borrow, so competition for reserves is now low and small changes in their supply no longer induce the same changes in the cost of borrowing them that they once did. This means that open market operations are no longer sufficient to drive the cost of borrowing in the fed funds market to the FOMC’s target. This can be seen clearly in the graphic above: the difference between the FOMC’s target for the fed funds rate and the actual fed funds rate increases and begins to gyrate wildly after 2007. This is where recent legislation becomes important. Section 201 of the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 amended the 1913 Federal Reserve Act to give the Fed the authority to pay interest on reserves beginning October 1, 2011. The 2008 Economic Stabilization Act brought this forward to October 1, 2008. These changes gave the Fed a new tool to implement monetary policy. Paying interest on reserves helps to set a floor under short-term rates because banks that can earn interest at the Fed are unwilling to lend to others below the rate the Fed is paying. This allows the FOMC to achieve its target for the fed funds rate even with high levels of excess reserves - as can be seen in the graphic from 2009 on. The FOMC has said that the Fed intends to rely on adjustments in the rate of interest on excess reserves to achieve its fed funds target rate as it begins to tighten monetary policy – likely later this year or early next. However, the 2006 Act gave authority for setting the rate of interest on excess reserves to the seven-member (currently five) Federal Reserve Board, and not to the twelve-member (currently ten) FOMC. This could be consequential. The Federal Reserve Act stipulates that the interest rate on reserves should not “exceed the general level of short-term interest rates,” but does not prevent the Board from setting it well below the general level of short-term interest rates. This means that the FOMC could decide that short-term rates should rise to, say, 4 percent, while the Board, thinking this excessive, could decide only to raise the rate on reserves to, say, 3 percent. Because the quantity of excess reserves is currently so massive, it would be virtually impossible for the trading desk at the New York Fed to conduct open market operations sufficient to achieve the 4 percent target set by the FOMC. Overnight rates would therefore trade closer to the Board-determined 3 percent rate on reserves. Section 505 of Senator Richard Shelby’s draft Financial Regulatory Improvement Act would transfer the authority to set the interest rate on reserves to the FOMC, which would restore its ability to control short-term rates generally. But unless and until such an act is passed, or the volume of excess reserves declines significantly, the Board, and not the FOMC, will control how quickly rates rise. This is potentially important because, as the graphic shows, the average Board member is considerably more dovish than the average non-Board FOMC member. Fed watchers may therefore be overestimating the pace of rate increases because they’re focusing on the comments of the wrong committee. For now, at least, it is the Board, and not the FOMC, that wields the real power over rate increases.

In 2006, the Fed had only two open swap lines outstanding, with Canada and Mexico, for just $2 billion and $3 billion, respectively. At its high point in 2008, the Fed had fourteen open swap lines, with as much as $583 billion drawn. The central bank that has been most active in creating swap lines, however, is China; the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is expected to sign a swap agreement with Chile this week, bringing the total number of outstanding swap lines to thirty-one. The extension of these swap lines is clearly part of China’s high-profile recent initiatives to internationalize the RMB. What is most interesting about this effort so far is that whereas everyone seems interested in having a swap line with China, almost no one has thus far had any interest in using it. And when they have used it the amounts accessed have been tiny – as shown in the middle figure in our graphic above. The only actual RMB swap use advertised by China was back in 2010, when it sent 20 billion yuan (about $3 billion) to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to enable companies in Hong Kong to settle RMB trade with the mainland. But this is basically China trading with itself. The Korean Ministry of Finance publicized a tiny swap in 2013 in which it accessed 62 million yuan (about $10 million) to help Korean importers make payments. The only interesting case is that of Argentina, which activated its RMB swap line last year, and has reportedly drawn $2.7 billion worth. The effect of the swaps on Argentina’s reserves is shown at the far right of the graphic. Argentina has the right to draw on a total of $11 billion worth of RMB. Its central bank has made a point of emphasizing that, under the terms of its agreement with the PBoC, the RMB may be freely converted into dollars – which Argentina, whose reserves have plummeted from $53bn in 2011 to $31bn today, is worryingly short of. In effect, then, what Argentina has done by activating the RMB swap line is to add “vouchers” for dollars, freeing up the actual dollars in its reserves for imminent needs, such as imports and FX market intervention, and signaling to the markets that billions more can be accessed in a pinch. The take-away is that whereas the RMB is slowly becoming an alternative to the dollar for settling Chinese goods trade, it is still far from being a currency that anyone actually needs – except maybe as a substitute for Fed dollar swap lines, which few central banks currently have access to. If Russia’s dollar reserves continue to fall, therefore, China may be the first place it turns.

Writing off debt, however, doesn’t make the pain disappear—it transfers it to the creditors. No doubt, Greece’s sovereign creditors, which now own 2/3 of Greece’s €324 billion debt, are in a much stronger position to bear that pain than Greece is. Nevertheless, we are talking real money here—2% of GDP for these creditors. Germany, naturally, would bear the largest potential loss—€58 billion, or 1.9% of GDP. But as a percentage of GDP, little Slovenia has the most at risk—2.6%. The most worrying case among the creditors, though, is heavily indebted Italy, which would bear up to €39 billion in losses, or 2.4% of GDP. Italy’s debt dynamics are ugly as is—the FT’s Wolfgang Münchau called them “unsustainable” last September, and not much has improved since then. The IMF expects only 0.5% growth in Italy this year. As shown in the bottom figure above, Italy’s IMF-projected new net debt for this year would more than double, from €35 billion to €74 billion, on a full Greek default—its highest annual net-debt increase since 2009. With a Greek exit from the Eurozone, Italy will have the currency union’s second highest net debt to GDP ratio, at 114%—just behind Portugal’s 119%. With the Bank of Italy buying up Italian debt under the ECB’s new quantitative easing program, the markets may decide to accept this with equanimity. Yet assuming that a Greek default is accompanied by Grexit, this can’t be taken for granted. Risk-shifting only works as long as the shiftees have the ability and willingness to bear it, and a Greek default will, around the Eurozone, undermine both.

The likely founders include many U.S. allies, such as the UK, Australia, and South Korea, which the Obama Administration had lobbied not to join, seeing the AIIB as a Chinese alternative to the U.S.-architected World Bank. The ally snub to Washington is a diplomatic failure for the Administration, although one that partially reflects the misguided refusal of the GOP-dominated Congress to ratify long-overdue IMF governance reform. This refusal made it that much easier for China to argue that new institutions to give fair voice to rising powers were both necessary and inevitable. One major U.S. ally that has not yet made a decision as to whether to join is Japan. The Obama Administration is presumably still opposed to its participation; but whatever the merits of that position before other G7 members decided to come on board, it should be abandoned now. It is no longer in U.S. interests. Governance of the new AIIB has not yet been determined, although China is believed to support a 75%/25% voting split between Asian and non-Asian members, with voting shares within each group allocated according to gross domestic product (GDP). China also foreswore veto power, which the U.S. has within the IMF and World Bank, in order to persuade U.S. allies to join. With such a governance structure, China will be highly dominant within the organization – having 43% of the votes, nearly 5 times more than number 2 India (if current-dollar GDP determines voting power), as shown in the left-hand figure above. U.S. ally countries – the UK, Germany, France, and other European nations, and Australia and South Korea in the Asia-Pacific – would have only 28% of the vote. With Japan as a member, however, close U.S. allies would have 41% of the vote – more than China’s 35%, as shown in the right-hand figure above. Therefore, even if the United States chooses to remain outside the AIIB, it should, at this point – assuming that it wishes to temper China’s dominance - be encouraging Japan to join.

In a recent blog post, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke argued that a “ global excess of desired saving over desired investment, emanating in large part from China and other Asian emerging economies and oil producers like Saudi Arabia, was a major reason for low global interest rates.” If this is so, then Chinese reserve sales can be expected to push up global rates. But is China actually selling reserves? The actual currency composition of China’s reserves is unknown – so no hard measurement of sales can be made. However, if we assume that the composition is approximately the same as that of other EMs – about 65% dollars, 20% euros, and 15% others – we can estimate it. As shown in the graphic above, once we strip out currency fluctuation effects – that is, the steep recent rise in the dollar - Chinese FX reserves actually increased mildly, rather than decreased, between last June and December. Thus Bloomberg’s assertion that China had “cut its stockpile” of reserves appears erroneous. So to the extent that Bernanke’s global savings glut thesis is accurate, China continues to exert downward pressure on global interest rates.

As a private in the US army, she saw the evil, the corruption, and the criminality of the institution she had enlisted to serve. To ignore this and do nothing would have only corrupted her, and so she did what she knew she had to do to expose it. Through the then little-known publisher Wikileaks, she released this vital information to the world, for all to see and judge. That’s a narrow view of what she released though, because —without a doubt — her decision in this matter also released a tidal wave of activism for freedom of information and the rights of leakers like her. It is far more than difficult to imagine what our political landscape today would look like without this singular choice: this one noble act of will. This is why there was no solitary corner that the U.S military could have stuffed her in that could have truly locked away the power of her life and deeds. Bars hold back flesh and steel can penetrate our bodies, but they are impotent to stop the willful goodness of any individual. The noble deed is now out there in the world, and in Chelsea’s case, her deed is everywhere in the world: accessible to and influencing the bedrock of our global civilization. There are those that have cast her leaking and subsequent arrest, trial, and incarceration as a David and Goliath story. With all the afterthought that was her harsh criminal conviction and all the wanton cruelty inflicted upon her by the most powerful government in the world, this is understandable. But let us never think of this woman as small. She is far larger than any prison or military fleet. The maintenance of such institutions drives the most powerful nation in the world into deeper and deeper debt. This is the result of acts made by small people with small lives in organizations they do not understand. Among these tiny cogs and instruments of death arose one individual who towered over them, all because she did the right thing. Fear is understandable. We all organize our lives around it, and there is no doubt that governments spring from our fear of chaos. We shrink ourselves down and submit to systems of incomprehensible structure and purpose. Chelsea did not shrink. She was not afraid of what would happen when she was seen, and when she exposed what was meant to be hidden. She was locked away because of fear also, but her consistent advocacy for freedom and transparency continued with greater resolve than ever.

{"text": "Caption Close Shadowed by protesters during his three-stop fundraising tour Monday in the East Bay, President Obama tried to link the courage shown in the aftermath of the mass shootings in Colorado to the resilience of Americans in the face of economic hardship. At the Piedmont home of two top campaign donors during a $38,500-per-person fundraiser, Obama said he realized after spending time Sunday with families and first responders after Friday's rampage in a Denver suburb that \"sometimes when bad things happen, horrible things happen, I think it's easy for us to slip into despair. \"And yet if you had spent some time, like I did, with those people, who had faced down just unimaginable pain with strength and grace, it would make you extraordinarily optimistic about America,\" Obama said. \"Americans are strong and they're resilient and they're optimistic about their futures and their kids' futures,\" he said. \"All they want to see is that their leadership shows the same decency and common sense that they try to apply every day in their own lives.\" It was part of a whirlwind day for the president, who appeared Monday evening before 2,0 people at a fundraiser at Oakland's Fox Theater, where $7,500 was the top ticket, and earlier at a $38,500-a-person gathering of two dozen donors at Oakland's Scottish Rite Center. At the Fox, a raucous group chanted \"four more years!\" while stomping and cheering inside the historic Art Deco facility. Obama made no mention of the liberal street activists opposing him during his East Bay visit, but he directly and indirectly called out presumed GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, criticizing the former Massachusetts governor for proposing \"to let foreclosures hit bottom\" and for an economic plan that gives \"tax breaks to millionaires and companies that are shipping jobs overseas.\" Earlier Monday, \"Gov. Romney was at it again, knowingly twisting my words around to suggest that I don't value small business,\" Obama said. \"I understand these are the games that are played in political campaigns. Although when folks omit entire sentences of what you said - splicing and dicing - they may have gone a little over the edge there.\" The audience interrupted him several times with cheers, words of encouragement or their own political analyses. \"What's holding us back right now is not the lack of big ideas,\" Obama said. \"It's .\" \"Congress!\" several people shouted. A few blocks away from Obama's Fox event, hundreds of protesters gathered throughout the day at the city's medical cannabis center - Oaksterdam University - to protest the federal crackdown on medical marijuana. They marched and held signs reading \"fight crime not cannabis\" and \"Obama keep your promise.\" Antiwar activists and other liberal protesters dissatisfied with Obama's policies joined the demonstrations. Obama's day, which began with an appearance in Reno where he touted his foreign policy achievements before a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, marked a return to the sharp exchanges of the campaign that had been suspended, briefly, in light of the Aurora, Colo., tragedy. On Friday, a lone gunman killed 12 moviegoers and injured 58 others at a film screening of \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" On Monday, Romney wrapped up a two-day, seven-fundraiser California swing that was expected to net his campaign $10 million. Romney appeared at an event for business leaders in Costa Mesa (Orange County), where the City Council voted last year to lay off half of the city's 450 employees, citing a projected $15 million deficit in the city's $114 million budget. \"I happen to think that for people who have spent their entire livelihood working in government, they sometimes don't appreciate just how hard it is to start a business, grow a business, maintain a business so that you can maintain employees and pay them better wages and better benefits,\" Romney told the group. Echoing a new, softer sounding TV commercial that his campaign released Monday, Obama sought to define the race less as a contrast of personalities and more as competing visions. \"You've got one side that believes that the way we're going to grow the economy and broaden opportunity is through additional tax cuts, $5 trillion worth, mostly going to folks who don't need those tax cuts and really aren't asking for them,\" Obama said in Piedmont, where he spoke for just nine minutes before taking questions. \"It's a theory we tested for almost a decade,\" he said, \"and it didn't work.\" Obama mingled with major financial players Monday at the Piedmont home of Wayne Jordan and Quinn Delaney, who have quietly become two of California's major campaign donors. In the past year, Jordan, an Oakland real estate developer, has contributed $200,0 to Priorities USA, a super PAC supporting Obama, and the same amount to American Bridge 21st Century, a liberal super PAC.

{"text": "A peer-reviewed study has found evidence that nearly all of global warming has been fabricated by climate scientists. On 9 July 2017, Breitbart News ran a story written by chart enthusiast James Delingpole, which carried a characteristically provocative and demonstrably false headline: ‘Nearly All’ Recent Global Warming Is Fabricated, Study Finds In it, Delingpole alleges that a “peer-reviewed” study (first “ exclusively” highlighted by the Daily Caller), written by “two scientists and a veteran statistician” found evidence that “much of global warming has been fabricated by climate scientists”: The peer-reviewed study by two scientists and a veteran statistician looked at the global average temperature datasets (GAST) which are used by climate alarmists to argue that recent years have been “the hottest evah” and that the warming of the last 120 years has been dramatic and unprecedented. What they found is that these readings are “totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data.” That is, the adjusted data used by alarmist organizations like NASA, NOAA, and the UK Met Office differs so markedly from the original raw data that it cannot be trusted. A Peer-Reviewed Study? Breitbart here lowers the bar for what passes as both “peer-reviewed” and a “study”. This report, published on a WordPress blog run by co-author Joseph D’Aleo — a meteorologist who did not complete a PhD, but who prominently advertises his honorarydoctorate on the document’s cover page — is not published in a scientific journal. Additionally, this study is not (as implied by some coverage) an official publication of the Cato Institute, despite the fact that co-author Craig Idso is an adjunct scientist there. “This study was not published by the Cato Institute,” a representative of the libertarian think tank told us. The claim of peer review, widely reported by numerous outlets, evidently stems from the second page of the report, in which the names of seven scientists (spanning a wide range of fields including aerospace engineering and economics, despite a complete lack of discussion of these topics in the report) appear under the banner “The Undersigned Agree with the Conclusions of this Report”. We reached out to these scientists to ask if this page was meant to imply that those listed individuals were the peer-reviewers news reports were speaking of. Only one person, George Wolff — a former Environmental Protection Agency atmospheric scientist who is now chief scientist for a company called Air Improvement Resource, Inc. —responded to our request. In a brief response, he simultaneously suggested that their inclusion on the document meant to imply they were the peer-reviewers, and that this process involved merely reading the study carefully: My approach to reviewing the report was the same as I have used for the hundreds of journal articles that I have reviewed. I read the report carefully and critically. I gave it a formal peer-review. Reading a study and saying that you agree with its conclusions is not how peer review works. A formalpeer-review is a structured process that by nature requires a third party, usually a journal editor, who oversees an iterative process of critiques and revisions. Given the fact that this study is not published in a journal but on a WordPress blog run by one of the co-authors, it is difficult to see how Wolff’s careful and critical reading of the document constitutes a formal peer review. In response to multiple requests for clarification on what Wolff meant by “formal peer review”, he indicated that the conversations were between only himself and the lead author, making the suggestion of peer review more philosophical than an argument rooted in objective reality: I provided critical comments to the lead author. We then discussed them and appropriate changes were made to the report. Breitbart’s Coverage of this “Study” The main argument of the Breitbart article via this “study” appears to be that if you look at global surface temperature records compiled by a variety of governmental organizations, corrections applied to this data since the 1980s have steadily biased the results toward making current warming appear more dramatic by depressing past temperatures and inflating recent temperatures. Delingpole even picked out his favorite chart that he claims makes this point: This chart shows the difference in the corrected global temperature values, by month, from a National Climatic Data Center ( NCDC) record produced in May 2008 compared to one produced with later corrections in June 2017. Importantly, they do not show a comparison between raw data and corrected data. Using the apparently revelatory finding that the addition of more or higher quality data to a record can change and improve it over time, Breitbart cites co-author D’Aleo’s analysis to suggest that the chart shows past temperatures are intentionally and nefariously biased to be cooler, while recent temperatures are biased to be warmer: Note how most of the downward adjustments take place in the early twentieth century and most of the upward take place in the late twentieth century. According to meteorologist Joe D’Aleo, who co-authored the study with statistician James Wallace and Cato Institute climate scientist Craig Idso, this has the effect of exaggerating the warming trend. “Nearly all of the warming they are now showing are in the adjustments,” [D’Aleo said]. This statement implores us to falsely interpret the figure as showing changes to the raw data itself. As previously mentioned, however, this chart (and many similar ones in the “study”) shows changes between two versions of corrected data. To make the point Delingpole thinks D’Aleo is making, you would need to show that corrected records of climate relative to raw data make recent temperatures warmer than the raw data, and older records cooler. Considering the most significant adjustment to the data actually increases early 20th century temperatures without doing the same to the post-1950 data, this argument would be a nearly impossible one to make if burdened by facts. Here’s a comparison of a variety of corrected records compared to the raw (uncorrected data), showing that, in fact, the opposite of what D’Aleo is suggesting is the reality: The “Study” Itself Delingpole and D’Aleo’s argument, if it accurately represented the data it claimed to be analyzing, might sound reasonable in the absence of literally any other information, but sprinkle just a pinch of context onto it and the interpretation becomes increasingly unpalatable, even with those grains of salt with which Delingpole implores us to take climate science. To dive into that context, some background is needed. A bit about these records and how they are generated: Maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s NCDCand other governmental organizations, these historical records come from myriad disparate, often non-standardized, and difficult to interpret bits of information — things like ship logs, buoy data, and instrument readings from mercury and digital thermometers. Both historical and modern data are continually added to these databases. This heterogeneity of sources means there are a number of elements that, indeed, need to be adjusted if the record is to be internally consistent. One example comes from gradual changes made to the way in which temperature readings have been made since the 1950s, shifting from an evening reading to a morning reading, consequently shifting the raw data to become gradually cooler as morning temperature readings became more common. Another very significant set of corrections that needs to be made stems from multiple shifts in how sea temperatures (which are used to calculate ocean surface air temperatures) have been measured on ships. Prior to the 1940s, buckets were thrown off the side of a boat, pulled up, and measured on the spot with a thermometer. Later, people began to use the intake water temperature in ship’s engine rooms. Now, freestanding buoys are typically used, which provide relatively colder readings compared to engine room readings. (It was, in fact, an increased understanding of the difference between buoy data and engine room data that caused the most significant change documented by the figure that Breitbart chose to highlight.) Documenting the direction of these changes to the corrections, without explaining them, makes up a bulk of the main argument of the “study”. This section, which painstakingly reveals publicly available and well-discussed adjustments to historical climate records reads like a thriller, with the authors taking the reader chronologically step by step, through each mysterious (but also completely documented) correction to these global datasets. Zeke Hausfather is a scientist at Berkeley Earth, an independent non-governmental research group originally skeptical of the correction methods employed in these sorts climate records. He told us these corrections change over time due to increased data and better analytical tools to analyze that data: We have dramatically improved our ability to measure the Earth’s climate the last thirty years. And we’ve also launched a lot of efforts to collect all of the global temperature data. […] Scientists in the eighties and nineties undertook some pretty big efforts to go around and collect all the weather records from all the stations you can find in various parts of the world. And those sort of efforts have continued up through today. And so, when you look at their, for example, 1980 value from NASA, what that actually came from was about five hundred or so stations on land almost entirely in the northern hemisphere. That’s the best they had at the time so they said this is the best we can do for estimating global temperatures as these are all the stations that we have access to. Nowadays we actually have an ocean temperature record back to 1850 or so based on data from ships and more recently from buoys. And you know, two-thirds of the earth is ocean, so if you leave oceans out you’re gonna get a fairly incorrect answer. In the “study”, however, without once attempting to explain the reasons for the corrections, the authors boldly (and unconvincingly) conclude: Clearly the historical GAST data adjustments that have been made have been dramatic and invariably have been favorable to Climate Alarmists’ views regarding Global Warming. The question now is whether the latest versions of GAST data by NOAA, NASA and Hadley are credible for policy analysis, or even climate modeling, purposes. Ignoring, once again, that adjustments to these records — relative to the raw data — decrease apparent warming across the 20th and 21st century, it is also worth noting that Berkeley Earth has painstakingly reviewed this process with their own independent methodology, concluding that the records produced by NCDC and others accurately represent global temperature trends. Hausfather was the lead author on that 2017 study. The authors of the “study” Breitbart cites then attempt to make the point that the raw data from “exceptionally high quality sources” (for which they provide no selection criteria) demonstrate an ambiguously defined “natural cycle” gradually erased by malicious intent of data adjustments. Almost all of these records are from northern North America and literally all of them are from the Northern Hemisphere. Without acknowledging the geographical limits of their data, the authors conclude: Thus, it seems that beyond any doubt, the U.S. data reflected in the Global Average Surface Temperature data calculation should contain the cyclical patterns shown above. As previously mentioned, data used in the earliest records did indeed show this Northern Hemisphere signal more prominently because — follow us here — the vast majority was from land stations in North America. However, when you add the Southern Hemisphere signal —a crucial element in the “global” concept inherent to global warming — you are going to dampen the results a bit. This is one of the things that has been happening to that record since its earliest incarnation, says Hausfather: The [1980 NASA record is] only based on about five hundred stations almost entirely from the Northern Hemisphere, you do see a bit more warmth in the ’30’s and ’40’s. Again [this is] because you’re only looking at Northern Hemisphere lands. But when you add in the oceans, when you add in the Southern Hemisphere, that sort of mid-century warmth doesn’t completely go away, but it becomes much smaller. Ultimately, the central argument of this study and its representation by Breitbart and others is one based on a willful misreading of data propelled by a study whose academic rigor has been misrepresented. As such, we rank the claim that climate scientists have created global warming entirely through corrections to raw data as false. While these corrections to raw historical data have shifted over time, the cumulative effect of all corrections applied to the raw data has been to reduce apparent global warming over the industrialized period, not the other way around. “If scientists were actually cooking the books,” Hausfather told us “we’d be cooking them in the wrong directions.” Filed Under: breitbart climate change daily caller +1more peer review Fact Checker: Alex Kasprak Featured Image: maraga / Shutterstock.com Published:14 July 2017 Delingpole, James. “Delingpole: ‘Nearly All’ Recent Global Warming Is Fabricated, Study Finds” Breitbart News. 9 June 2017 Wallace, James, P., I, et al. “On the Validity of NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU Global Average Surface Temperature Data &amp; The Validity of EPA’s CO2 Endangerment Finding”.

{"text": "The Big Conversation The first day of arguments in a pivotal court battle have pushed Texas' new abortion restrictions back into the spotlight. U.S. District JudgeLee Yeakelon Monday opened a hearing in Austin that will provide the first test of whether the state's controversial new abortion law can withstand legal scrutiny, as the Tribune'sBecca Aaronson reports. In the courtroom, the plaintiffs — which include the Center for Reproductive Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union and a coalition of women's health providers, including Planned Parenthood —challenged two of the new law's provisions that pertain to hospital admitting privileges and medical abortions. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. \"Currently, there’s no abortion clinics west of I-35 that will be able to perform this service\" if the hospital admitting privileges provision goes into effect,Dr. Paul Fine, the medical director of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, testified. The plaintiffs say 22,0 womenwill lose access to the procedure every year under the new rule. Meanwhile, lawyers for the state, who cast doubt on the abortion rights supporters' data, denied that the law created undue burdens on women seeking abortions. In a shift from this summer's legislative fight, when Republicans repeatedly cited women's safety as justification for the law, the state's legal team also said the restrictions sought to advance the state's interest in promoting fetal life. \"The Constitution allows the state to protect fetal life in this manner so long as it does not impose an undue burden,\" said Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, according to the San Antonio Express-News. Early in the day, Yeakel, who is expected to issue a ruling by Monday, acknowledged that he wouldn't likely have the final word in the case. \"I would be shocked if whoever was displeased by my ruling did not appeal,\" he said. But he added that he would weigh the law, not the politics of abortion. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. \"This court’s job is not to rule on whether women should be allowed abortions, but to rule on whether or not this statute comes within the existing constitutional confine,\" he said.

{"text": "Last known indigenous female brown bear in Pyrenees shot and killed The last known reproducing female brown bear in the Pyrenees along the French-Spanish border — known as Cannelle, French for “cinnamon” — has been shot and killed by hunters. The whereabouts of her 10-month-old cub, which fled after seeing his mother shot, are unknown. French gendarmes and wildlife officials have sealed off a wide area near the incident, banning dog walking and hunting, and are searching for the orphaned bear. French Environment Minister Serge Lepeltier called the killing an “ecological disaster,” and French President Jacques Chirac joined the widespread outcry over the incident. The boar hunters who shot the bear claimed their dogs were attacked and they were acting in self defense, though enviros say they knew full well that the bear and her cub were in the area. Indigenous Pyrenean mountain brown bears are now effectively doomed to extinction.", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Some procedural hiccups are going to delay the tax reform bill getting to President Trump's desk by a few hours. The Senate parliamentarian has said a few minor provisions in the legislation - including, no joke, its title - violate the chamber's procedural rules. Those provisions will have to be changed in the bill before the Senate can pass it. This will then will also require the House to pass the legislation again, even though the House already cleared the bill comfortably earlier on Tuesday. In short: The Senate is expected to pass the tax overhaul on Tuesday night, and the House will pass it (again) on Wednesday. The vote counts still look solid. The mishap is purely procedural. Republicans are passing their tax overhaul in the Senate using the \"budget reconciliation\" process, which allows a bill to advance with only 51 votes but comes with some restrictions. Those rules generally require that the tax bill's policies directly affect federal spending and revenue and that the plan doesn't increase the federal deficit after 10 years. The tax bill that the House passed Tuesday has a few minor infractions, the Senate parliamentarian said, according to a statement from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the ranking member caucusing with the Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee. The provisions relate to the use of special tax accounts for homeschooling and the criteria for determining whether a private university's endowment should be subject to taxes, per Sanders's office. The bill's so-called short title - the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act - was also found not to comply with the \"Byrd rule\" that governs reconciliation. These are relative peanuts in the context of a $1 trillion corporate tax cut. The bulk of the bill will be untouched. It will still slash the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, still cut the top individual rate, still roll back the estate tax. The GOP's tax overhaul is moving remarkably fast by congressional standards. If Trump signs it into law later this week, it will have been introduced, passed by Congress, and signed by the president in less than two months.", "label": "true"}
{"text": "Editor's note: This story has been updated throughout. One day after endorsing Donald Trump for president, Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz refused Saturday to say whether he thinks the Republican nominee is fit to lead the country. In an interview with the Texas Tribune’s Evan Smith, Cruz said he endorsed Trump because the November election is a binary choice between Hillary Clinton and Trump. The junior senator from Texas and unsuccessful presidential candidate said he is voting Trump because he worries Clinton would appoint liberal justices to the U.S. Supreme Court and do damage to the country. Smith asked: “Do you consider Donald Trump to be fit to be president?” The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Cruz paused, then answered: “I think we have one of two choices.” But that was as far as he was willing to go. With each of his carefully worded answers, Cruz made clear that he worries about what a Trump presidency would mean. And he still struggles with some of the things Trump did during the campaign, such as mock Cruz’s wife’s looks and suggest without any evidence that Cruz’s father was involved in the Kennedy assassination. “I have no intention of defending everything Donald Trump says and does,” he said. “I have been very clear that I have significant disagreements with him.” But, in Cruz’s framing, one thing would be worse than a Trump presidency: A Clinton presidency. Smith listed several of the things Cruz has said about Trump in the past, including calling the New York businessman “utterly immoral,” “a sniveling coward,” “a pathological liar” and “a serial philanderer.” Did he mean those things? The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. “I have had many, many disagreements with Donald Trump, some of which you have cataloged,” Cruz said. “And I have not been at all reluctant to articulate exactly why I believe that I should be the nominee instead of him.” He later added, “We are in a general election now. I don’t think it is productive for me to criticize the Republican nomine today.” Cruz was speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin before a crowd of hundreds. He received a mixed reaction from the bipartisan crowd. Many cheered him, but he also received jeers. Cruz had held off on endorsing Trump for months after dropping out of the Republican primary for president. Most notably, he was booed loudly at the Republican National Convention for saying voters should “vote your conscience” in lieu of explicitly throwing his support behind the nominee. Cruz’s rivalry with Trump became personal when Trump speculated that Cruz’s Cuban father was involved in the Kennedy assassination and retweeted an unflattering picture of Cruz’s wife. Cruz said he talked to Trump Friday, and that Trump has not apologized for the attacks. But Cruz said he, his father and his wife made the collective decision to forgive him. Issues like Supreme Court nominees are more important, he said. “At the end of the day, it’s not about me.” At the end of the interview, Cruz took two questions from the audience, both from attendees clearly angry over his choice. But Cruz was tempered in his defense of his decision to endorse. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. The first questioner, a Muslim woman, asked how she could feel safe with a president who she believes is a racist. Cruz answered, “That is a question you are going to have to ask yourself.” He then went on to warn about the danger of “radical Islamic terrorism” and said he worries that Hillary Clinton won’t defeat it. The next questioner mentioned Cruz’s two young daughters. “How can you support a candidate who is so openly misogynist?” “That is a question I have wrestled with,” Cruz replied. The answer, he said, is that Clinton would appoint as many as four liberals to the Supreme Court. “If Hillary Clinton is elected president, the court will be lost for a generation and that means my daughter’s rights will be lost for a generation,” he said. And while most of the questions were about the presidential race, Cruz was also asked about his political future. Trump has expressed support for the idea that another Republican should challenge Cruz in his 2018 Senate re-election bid. The most common candidate mentioned is U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, an outspoken supporter of Trump’s from Texas. When asked if Cruz is afraid of McCaul, Cruz simply said, “No.” “I don’t think Texans want a senator who will just go to Washington to roll over and go along to get along,” Cruz said. Does McCaul do that? “That is a judgment that the voters are going to have to make,” he said.", "label": "false"}

{"text": "Legal analysts say Tuesday's oral arguments at the Supreme Court indicate that the court will likely deem the national health care law’s individual mandate unconstitutional. In the second of three days of high-stakes hearings, the nine justices questioned government attorneys specifically about the mandate, which requires Americans to purchase health insurance. It is also the piece of the law that has drawn the most fire from opponents. Throughout the blogosphere and all over cable news, the same theme emerged: Court watchers sensed nothing but skepticism from key justices and deduced that they will pull the plug on the provision. CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said, “This law looks like it is going to be struck down. I am telling you: All of the predictions, including mine, that the justices would not have a problem with this law were wrong.” Justice Anthony Kennedy’s line of questioning caught most of the attention, as he has been the “swing” vote in many cases that have divided the court evenly between conservative and liberal members. Kennedy interrupted U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli’s argument defending the law with just the second question of the day: “Can you create commerce in order to regulate it?” he wanted to know. “That is not what is going on here,” Verrilli answered. “What is being regulated is the method of financing the purchase of health care. That itself is economic activity with substantial effects on interstate commerce.” Other justices piggybacked on Kennedy’s question, likening health care to food, transportation and emergency services and asking whether the government can require Americans to purchase anything that would satisfy those basic human needs. In other words, is the government creating a market for insurance when there isn’t one for Americans who don’t already have it? Verrilli argued that most every American will require health care at some point in their lives, which is why such a market already exists. But Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out that it is unknown if a person would ever need a heart transplant. In the same vein, he said, people also may need emergency assistance but cannot know that in advance, leading him to ask if the government can require Americans to purchase cell phones in order to call rapid responders, should the need arise. Verrilli answered: “I don’t think we think of that as a market. This is a market. This is market regulation.” Justice Samuel Alito joined in, pointing out that there must be a market for burial services, as well, because death is a certainty. A defensive Verrilli replied that such a cost wouldn’t shift to others, but Alito disagreed. Kennedy jumped back in and tried to get Verrilli to concede that there is a “heavy burden of justification to show authorization under the Constitution” because the mandate changes “the relation of the individual to the government” in what he called a unique way. As the arguments continued, another point of contention was whether the penalty for not purchasing insurance becomes a tax and whether, therefore, the mandate itself constitutes a tax. But liberal members of the court asserted that that isn’t the case because the penalty would not be collected in order raise revenue for the government.

{"text": "The emerging shape of battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama is not reassuring. Obama won hearts because he filled them with hope for an America marked by cleaner politics and more ethical interaction with the world. Clinton won many minds by making those who worry about America’s enemies and economic troubles feel that she offers a more masterly set of hands at the tiller. She played dirty but Barack kept the high road until the shocks of Ohio, Texas and Rhode Island. It now seems that he too is stepping into the dirt and readying for a knife fight with the wily lady. This should give everyone pause for thought because it opens new ways in which Hillary can give pain to Barack. It’s early days but European analysts are already turning away from Barack. For them, he does not seem to have what it takes to change America. Instead the American electorate is changing him. He looked blue-collar America in the eye in Ohio and blinked. Even that was done too late to convince the working classes that he is not an upper middle class white American who is using his black skin color to make us believe that he knows life on slummy urban streets or the red neck rural and industrial heartland. He looked like a person on whose fresh vision we could depend without doubt. That seems dubious now. Suddenly, for him as well the race is boiling down to one word, “Character”. Does he have the spine to do what he promised to all those hundreds of thousands whose money contributions through the Internet have made him a candidate far richer than Hillary? Like a crusty village battle-axe wanting to tear at her opponent’s hair in an alley, Hillary has needled Barack into losing his lofty composure. Her repeated taunts have made him doubt himself and he is preparing to knee-cap her if she tries to knee-cap him. Whatever his skills at digging up her and Bill’s murky finances and cloaked shenanigans, he cannot hope to win a street fight with her. People always, in any country, go for the underdog in such cases and she is the underdog regardless of how deftly she knifes at his gut because she is a woman. There is no way in which Barack can change that. The elite punditry of America seems mesmerized by the math of Barack’s lead and equates it with his popularity among people. Being close to the terrain, they are losing sight of the forest. Blue collar America rules the nation through the ballot box and Barack has failed to bring hope to that vital base of the pyramid. In the end, the super delegates will do whatever they think will keep the Democrats united and in favor with voters. What they say now is not necessarily what they will do when the time comes, since even a day is a long time in politics. Barack attracts the middle layer and some at the pyramid’s top with his fine thoughts about raising the human and moral quality of the average citizen. But that average citizen is more worried about bread on the table and adequate shelter right now than refining his self-development or making America more respected around the world for its moral values and love of peace. Both Hillary and Barack plaintively suggest in turn that the media caused some of their reverses. This is a self-serving charge to cover their failures at communication since both are experts at manipulating the media for their own ends and each is surrounded by consultants familiar with how it works. Barack is caught between a rock and a hard place. If he fights dirty, he will betray those who fought in his corner so far. Will he then reimburse those who poured millions into this campaign through the web? If he sticks to the high road, he may lose the knife fight. The only way to win without rolling in the mud is to tell blue collar America why he can do more for it than Hillary. It may already be too late for that. In any case, he seems short on ideas. Thus to the surprise of many, Hillary may laugh all the way to the bank. Math counts for less than irrational emotion in the privacy of the ballot box. Right now she has the kind of emotional high ground that appeals to voters struggling to make ends meet after pay day. The super delegates will not be insensitive to that.", "label": "false"}
{"text": "If Bhutan were a person, it would be that friend who somehow manages to eat only superfoods, go to yoga at least three times a week, and still be totally fun to hang out with. Best known for its Gross National Happiness model (on which it scores quite high), the tiny Himalayan country now says it wants also to be the first nation to go 100 percent organic. That means, according to the AFP, that the country will “phase out artificial chemicals in farming in the next 10 years, making its staple foods of wheat and potatoes, as well as its fruits, 100 percent organic.” The policy will only apply to food grown in the country, and NPR reports that Bhutan imports some of its rice from India, so in theory some Bhutanese people could still be eating rice coated with chemicals. But it’s still a pretty lofty goal. To be fair, Bhutan’s already most of the way there. Without particularly speedy roads, most farmers don’t have easy access to chemical fertilizers and don’t bother using them. One of the oft-mentioned objections to organic farming, though, is that it’ll require more land than conventional techniques, and Bhutan doesn’t have much to spare, according to AFP: Overwhelmingly forested, no more than three percent of the country’s land area is used for growing crops, says Gyamtsho, with the majority of farmers already organic and reliant on rotting leaves or compost as a natural fertiliser. So it remains to be seen whether Bhutan can pull this off, but we’re betting they’ll be happy about it either way.", "label": "false"}
{"text": "More on: Development This piece is part of an ongoing Development Channel series on global justice and development. Whether or not justice will be part of the world’s post-2015 global development agenda remains an open question. Many states have expressed support for including a strong commitment to justice in any new development goals. The Open Working Group of the United Nations, which is charged with putting together a framework proposal for those new goals, recently released a statement that endorsed the inclusion of rule of law and justice as important for peace, security, and capable institutions. However, some states have raised concerns regarding infringements on national sovereignty, and others argue that the focus on domestic justice reform neglects governance and rule of law failures at the international level. In response to this high-level dithering, civil society groups around the world have issued a “Justice 2015” appeal: an open letter to the UN General Assembly that urges the inclusion of justice in the post-2015 development goals. A recent blog post from Nicholas Menzies of the World Bank proposes a menu approach of justice targets and indicators that could be used in the post-2015 development framework. My previous posts on this same topic explored the main trade-offs and issues that need to be considered in measuring justice and rule of law. High diplomacy usually leaves little opportunity for outside input, but this case seems to be an exception. On April 24-25, the President of the General Assembly will host a Thematic Debate on \"Ensuring Stable and Peaceful Societies.” And on June 9-10 there will be a High Level Event on Human Rights and the Rule of Law in the Post-2015 Development Agenda. In both cases, leaders will be looking to civil society for guidance. What do you think? More on: Development More on: Development Rule of Law Emerging Voices features contributions from scholars and practitioners highlighting new research, thinking, and approaches to development challenges.This article is fromNema Milaninia, a legal officer in the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The views expressed are those of the author alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the United Nations or the ICTY. This piece is part of an ongoing Development Channel series on global justice and development. In 1994, the international community reacted to brutal crimes committed in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia by establishing tribunals mandated to bring those most responsible to justice. The thinking was that justice would help restore and maintain peace in those regions struggling to recover from divisive tragedies. But today, the relationship between justice, peace, and political stability faces serious scrutiny. How governments and international organizations choose to view that relationship has huge implications for how individuals responsible for mass atrocities will be held accountable. The recent prosecution of Kenyan leaders in the International Criminal Court (ICC) sheds light on the tenuous balance between stability and justice. In October 2013, leaders of the African Union (AU) passed a resolution requestingthat the ICC defer its trials against Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto – both charged with organizing post-electoral violence in Kenya that resulted in the deaths of over 1,0 civilians and the displacement of another 250,0 or more people. The resolution argued that the ICC cases could “undermine [Kenya’s] sovereignty, stability, and peace.” In 2009, the AU passed a similar resolution concerning ICC proceedings against Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmad al Bashir, out of fear that his genocide case could “undermine the ongoing efforts aimed at facilitating the early resolution of the conflict in Darfur.” Both of these cases currently face serious obstacles: in Kenya, witnesses have withdrawn, likely due to bribery, pressure, and a climate of hostility. And al Bashir continues to evade extradition to The Hague. Resistance to the ICC is not unique to Africa. Just last year, the Russian government stated that referring the ongoing conflict in Syria to the ICC would be “ill-timed and counterproductive” to peace efforts. Some argue that in conflict or post-conflict situations, the emphasis should be on ensuring security, encouraging economic development, rebuilding key institutions, and disarming belligerent groups. In this view, justice is placed in juxtaposition with peace, and other factors usually weigh against holding leaders accountable. For example, the perpetrators of an atrocity, or their chosen successors, often retain or come into power after a conflict ends. In other cases, both sides of the conflict commit abuses and there is a fear that the quest for justice might undermine reconciliation. Increasingly, however, studies show that the justice or peace dichotomy is false. Instead of being at odds, there is an important and fundamental link between justice, stability, and economic development. In 2010, the International Institute on Higher Criminal Studies (IIHCS) published a survey of world conflicts that took place from 1945 to 2008. The study found that of the over 300 conflicts that took place during that period, nearly all were of a non-international or internal character and were largely concentrated in developing countries in Asia and Africa. The conflicts themselves were usually caused by poverty, exploitation, corruption, and other factors relating to economic, social, and political grievances. Furthermore, the survey found that those who promoted conflict in poor countries were often motivated by personal greed and were willing to surrender their states to the interests of foreign governments (such as in the Cold War) or foreign corporations. In the vast majority of cases, perpetrators of crimes escaped accountability. More often than not, justice was sacrificed for short-term political expediency. However, as the IIHCS study revealed, stability, security, and democracy are actually strengthened by a post-conflict commitment to accountability. Openly facing past violence is essential to prevent future violence. It is for these reasons that Kenya’s key aid donors and senior Washington officials support the ICC process, viewing impunity for state corruption and political violence as a threat to Kenya’s long-term stability. There is also indication that international prosecutions helped prevent another outbreak of election-related violence when Kenyans voted for a new president in 2013. Of course, balancing political and economic development with accountability will always be a case-by-case determination. Just as conflicts arise from distinct issues and involve different types of violence, post-conflict resolutions must also be context-specific. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to ensuring justice and stability following major conflicts. But there is at least strong indication and growing international consensus that justice and stability are collaborative and not mutually exclusive concepts. Despite this finding, international justice institutions like the ICC continue to suffer from budgetary restraints and limited state cooperation, particularly from the most powerful countries in the world. Without more resources and support, the prospect of realizing both justice and peace risks being reduced to an aspiration instead of a reality.

In January 2012, health ministers from around the world gathered in Bangkok and committed themselves to raising “universal health coverage on the national, regional and global agendas.” Within a year, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on UHC, encouraging national governments worldwide to “plan or pursue the transition towards universal access to affordable and quality health-care services.” Since then, the World Health Organization and the World Bank have worked together to encourage global action on instituting UHC. Over seventy countries have enacted UHC or similar programs within their borders. But even with growing political commitment, difficult decisions remain regarding what health services will be covered by UHC, given that resources for health are finite and demand is seemingly limitless. This is especially true in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which typically face tough budget constraints. In setting priorities about what to cover, policymakers have to address some thorny questions, such as: how can evidence and social values be systematically incorporated into the design of health plans? How do you ensure a proper balance between promotive and preventive care on the one hand, and curative and rehabilitative care on the other? Which types of patients receive what interventions, when, and at what cost? Very often, the selection of services and technologies to be covered is based on cost effectiveness with respect to health outcomes. But any UHC plan should also take equity, financial protection, and social values into account. Unfortunately, health care coverage in many LMICs is associated with general inefficiency, wasted money, and needless illness and death. For example, in India, even though only 44 percent of children under two years old are fully vaccinated, open-heart surgery is subsidized in national public hospitals. Similarly, in Colombia, only 58 percent of children are fully vaccinated, but public monies are used to subsidize a breast cancer treatment considered ineffective and unsafe in the United States. In both cases, expensive and potentially wasteful services are prioritized over cost effective and equity-enhancing health interventions. In order to correct this problem, countries should ensure that they have an adequate amount of certain affordable drugs that satisfy the health care needs of their population, consult health insurance priority lists, and incorporate technology-related policy-making in health care to encourage the use of cost-effective health care tools. This requires building capacities to produce quality data and developing evidence-based decision-making. Fortunately, in many LMICs, data, methods, and evidence on the costs, effectiveness, and equity of health interventions are increasingly available. But health care resources and interventions remain skewed in favor of the privileged and politically-connected. As UHC generates more demand for better health care, in turn putting financial pressure on governments, public spending will respond even more to interest groups and wealthy populations. This makes it imperative that countries invest in independent institutions to overcome the inherent biases of participatory politics, which tends to favor the loudest, best connected, and most articulate, but not always those most in need of care. More on: Health More on: Politics and Government Human Rights Rule of Law Foreign Aid As protestors from Kiev to Khartoum to Caracas take to the streets against autocracy, a new book from economist William Easterly reminds us that Western aid is too often on the wrong side of the battle for freedom and democracy. In The Tyranny of Experts: Economists, Dictators, and the Forgotten Rights of the Poor,Easterly slams the development community for supporting autocrats, not democrats, in the name of helping the world’s poorest. Ignoring human rights abuses and giving aid to oppressive regimes, he maintains, harms those in need and in many ways “un-develops” countries. The Tyranny of Expertstakes on the notion that autocracies deliver stronger economic growth than freer societies. Easterly argues that when economic growth occurs under autocratic regimes, it is more often achieved at the local level in spite of the regime’s efforts. In some instances, growth under autocracies can be attributed to relative increases in freedoms. He points to China as an example of this, attributing the country’s phenomenal growth to its adoption of greater personal and economic freedoms, especially compared to the crippling Maoist policies of the past. Easterly also rejects the myth that dictators are dependable and that a certain level of oppression should be overlooked for the sake of economic growth and overall prosperity. Most recently, the violence and chaos following the 2011 Arab uprisings has made some nostalgicfor the stable, if undemocratic, governments that kept civil unrest in check, allowing for a measure of economic development to take hold. Easterly stresses that instability and tumult in the wake of ousting a dictator is not the fault of an emerging democracy, but instead an understandable result of years of autocratic rule. The answer is not to continue to support autocrats in the name of stability, but rather to start the inevitably messy process of democratization sooner. Easterly is of course not the first to call attention to the importance of prioritizing rights and freedoms in the development agenda. Scholars from Amartya Sento more recently, Thomas Carothers and Diane de Gramont, have also advocated for a rights-based approach to development. In Pathways to Freedom: Political and Economic Lessons From Democratic Transitions, my coauthors and I similarly found that economic growth and political freedom go hand-in-hand. Still, the hard questions remain: how to help those without economic and political freedoms? And when should donors walk away from desperately poor people because their government is undemocratic? Easterly argues that the donor community should draw the line with far more scrutiny than it does today – not just at the obvious cases, such as North Korea, but with other undemocratic countries, such as Ethiopia, where human rights abuses are rampant. He debunks the notion that aid can be “apolitical,” arguing that it is inherently political: giving resources to a government allows it to control and allocate (or withhold) resources as it sees fit. The aid community should focus on ways to help oppressed populations without helping their oppressors. For example, scholarship programs, trade, and other people-to-people exchanges can give opportunities to people in need. At the very least, Easterly argues, development actors should not praise oppressive regimes or congratulate them on economic growth they did not create. Rather than being seduced by “benevolent dictators,” Easterly urges donors to focus their energy on “freedom loving” governments that need help. The Millennium Challenge Corporationis a step in the right direction but, as Easterly pointed out during the CFR meeting, MCC’s approach is undermined by other U.S. aid agencies, such as USAID, that continue to assist countries even when they don’t meet certain good governance and human rights standards. Easterly also emphasizes the need for aid organizations to be more transparent about where their money is going. Robert Zoellick made strides in this direction during his tenure as World Bank president. But more recent developmentssuggest that the Bank still has a way to go in becoming more open and accountable. (Easterly noted that an initial invitation to speak about The Tyranny of Experts at the World Bank was later rescinded for “scheduling reasons.”) More on: Politics and Government Human Rights Rule of Law Foreign Aid More on: Economics Gender Diplomacy and International Institutions Last week, the world celebrated the 106th International Women’s Day. This year’s theme, \"Equality for Women is Progress for All,\" called attention to the strides that women have made toward gender equality. Yet despite important gains, women remain less likely than men to be educated, have access to healthcare, or hold political office. No country in the world has achieved gender equalityin economic terms, with women lagging behind men in income, access to resources and credit, and employment opportunities. Studies show that even without taking gender into account, access to credit is the greatest obstacle that small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) face in growing. For women, viewed by banks and investors as “riskier” clients, the struggle for credit, capital, and financial services is even more difficult. Although SME financing exists in a number of developing economies, women--who run more than a third of formal SMEs globally—still struggle to reach capital, capacity-building, and other services their businesses need to thrive. The International Finance Corporation estimates that there is a $285 billion financing gap for women-owned SMEs functioning in the formal sector of developing economies. In an effort to help address this problem, Goldman Sachs and the World Bank recently launched the world’s first-ever global financing fund focused on providing women-owned SMEs with access to capital. The fund, known as the Women Entrepreneurs Opportunity Facility, aims to raise $600 million to provide 100,0 women entrepreneurs with access to the financial resources and education they need. Goldman Sachs is one in a growing group of firms that recognizes the economic gains of bringing women into the formal financial sector. At present, many women-owned businesses exist in informal economic sector where enterprises are less productive, difficult to expand, and vulnerable to natural and man-made disasters. Additionally, employees of informal businesses have little social protection or safeguards against corruption. As a recent report by Goldman Sachs’ public policy research arm, Global Markets Institute,shows, economic equality for women represents a path to economic progress for all. The report suggests that narrowing the credit gap for female business owners in BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and the “Next 11” countries, including Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey, could raise incomes per capita by 12 percent or more. Some countries, such as Vietnam, could see gains above 25 percent. The public and private sectors both stand to benefit when women are able to fully participate in their economies and contribute to their communities. Providing financing for women-owned SMEs, offering platforms that encourage female entrepreneurship, and bringing women into the formal financial sector will not only spur growth but transform societies. And as the World Bank’s recent Gender at Workreport notes, this is good for everyone who cares about creating a more stable and prosperous future.

This article is fromBenjamin D. Stone,director of strategy and general counsel at MicroCredit Enterprisesand vice chairman of Indego Africa. Here he discusses Indego Africa’s experiences grappling with the tension between a social enterprise’s social mission and commercial goals. Social enterprises enable people in the developing world to chart their own courses out of poverty by combining effective aspects of public and private sector ventures and harnessing market-driven forces. Yet, as I have learned through my work at the nonprofit social enterprise Indego Africa (IA), appropriately balancing a social enterprise’s social mission and commercial aspirations is immensely challenging. Based on my experience, when these prerogatives conflict, a social enterprise must ground decisions in a consistent long-term vision. Launched in 2007, IA partners with over 500 female entrepreneurs who operate within small for-profit businesses in Rwanda called cooperatives. IA connects these women with global markets by selling their jewelry, accessories, and home décor on IA’s online store, to boutiques and stores worldwide, and to major brands in the United States. The revenue covers IA’s operational costs, including raw materials, shipping, fair-trade wages for the artisans, and employee salaries. The remaining money is pooled with donations and grants to fund training programs for the artisans in business, literacy, and technology. IA has helped artisan partners put more of their kids in school, increase the number of meals their families eat per day, access running water, and more. But its mission goes beyond achieving temporary impact: IA aims to equip female artisans with the skills and confidence they need to compete in the global markets long term, without assistance. To achieve this ambitious goal, and balance commercial and social objectives, IA started out with two rules for choosing artisan partnerships. First, IA only partnered with women who were already members of a registered cooperative, so that these women would view IA as a business partner rather than co-founder. Second, IA only partnered with women who already knew basic artisan skills to ensure that, with minimal training, they would be capable of producing complex orders on tight timetables. These rules remained sacrosanct until 2010 when two NGOs, Survivor’s Fund and Foundation Rwanda, asked IA to help twenty-five remarkable women from the Kayonza district of Rwanda start an artisan cooperative. The women were all mothers of children conceived by rape that occurred during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide. Most were poor, illiterate, HIV positive, and did not know how to sew or weave. Even in the face of such difficult circumstances, these women were determined to give themselves and their children a better life. Despite its two rules, IA agreed to take on the challenge. IA helped the women build a cooperative, named Abasangiye, and conducted business and literacy training. IA also went beyond normal practice by subsidizing the cost of Abasangiye’s rent and transportation, and hiring women from another cooperative partner to teach Abasangiye artisans how to sew. The extra investment paid off: the women completed a stream of profitable orders for several major brands, including Nicole Miller, J.Crew, DANNIJO, and Anthropologie. Many started to learn English. Two of Abasangiye’s members were selected to attend the Goldman Sachs 10,0 Women program at Rwanda’s School of Finance and Banking and later joined seventeen other IA artisan partners as graduates of the school’s expedited MBA program. Out of the twelve cooperatives IA works with, Abasangiye remains the only one formed by IA because the financial cost and time required to launch it are too high to replicate. But making this exception to IA’s partnership rules reinforced the organization’s long-term vision. Although the women of Abasangiye still have many challenges ahead, they are increasingly engaging the global markets on their own terms as confident, empowered businesswomen. In other instances, IA has found it more sensible to uphold its self-imposed rules. In 2011, a prominent international retailer offered to make a large order that would have required IA to take a significant financial loss, but that would have allowed one cooperative partner to earn more money in one month then they might normally make in six. It was an enticing offer: great income for the artisans and terrific brand exposure for IA. Accepting the offer, however, would have damaged IA’s balance sheet and undermined its core vision by settling for a one-time profit for the women instead of taking a sustainable business approach to empowering entrepreneurs. IA declined the order, and its savvy artisan partners supported the choice. And the decision paid off. IA is now a renowned lifestyle brand facilitating profitable and consistent orders that give artisans the revenue and experience to achieve long-term success. Tension between a social enterprise’s social mission and commercial goals is a healthy byproduct of the public-private hybrid approach. During these times of ambiguity, social enterprises must rely on a consistent long-term vision for guidance. It is this approach that I hope will allow IA to have lasting impact that endures for generations.

In the next two decades, 28 million girls in India will be married before their eighteenth birthdays if current trends continue. In rural areas across India, most girls are married before they turn seventeen, which has devastating consequences not just for these girls and their children, but also for society as a whole. Moushumi Khatun, a thirteen year old living in a rural area of the state of West Bengal, is trying to avoid the path her two older sisters were forced to take: both were married off to older men before the age of seventeen, and the eldest is already a mother of two at age eighteen. Khatun is fighting an uphill battle; in much of rural India, girls eat last and least. They are born underweight and remain that way for much of their lives. Parents marry off their young daughters out of fear that the family name will be tarnished if the girl remains unmarried, or that they will have to pay a higher dowry for an older bride. Even Khatun’s mother said, “I am not comfortable keeping a daughter unmarried past fifteen or sixteen.” Her grandmother agrees: “It is destiny. This is not in our hands. This is the way it has always been.” But a new program, a partnership between the government of West Bengal and Landesa, the organization I work for, is offering girls the opportunity to challenge age-old tradition and change perceptions in the process. “Moushumi told me that early marriage is not healthy,” recalled her mother, who is now amenable to the idea of allowing her youngest to pursue a different path. Khatun learned of the dangers of child marriage during one of her bi-monthly meetings as part of the Girls Project pilot. At these meetings, Khatun and her peers learn about their right to an education, to not be married off as a child, and to inherit land. They also learn organic gardening skills that help them grow food for their families and perhaps one day sell excess produce. For many girls, the small change they earn through their vegetable patches helps pay school fees and counteract stereotypes of girls being little more than a drain on family finances. In the program, girls learn to grow fruits and vegetables on whatever free space they can find around their family’s homes. Many grow gourds on the roof of their homes, leafy greens in small patches next to their homes and even mushrooms in the spaces under their own beds. These tiny gardens can bring girls hundreds of rupees each year-- enough for school supplies and incidentals, but not enough to cover the entire cost of the girls’ dowries. Parents of rural girls routinely pay grooms’ families dowries that amount to thousands of rupees. There is a heavy financial pressure to marry girls early, as doing so can reduce their dowries. Still, Khatun and her best friend, fourteen-year-old Beauty Barman, both have small gardens and have been able to convince their families to keep them in school until they turn eighteen. Although their futures may seem of little consequence to anyone outside their village, empowering girls is central to the fight against global poverty and disease. Educated girls have fewer children and are 50 percent more likely to immunize their children. The benefits of empowering girls go far beyond the household as well: when 10 percent or more girls go to school, a country’s GDP increases by 3 percent on average. More than 40,0 girls are now participating in the Girls Project. A rigorous study has found that these girls are staying in school longer, marrying later, and are more likely to inherit land and have an economic asset in their name. The Indian government, conscious of the benefits of investing in girls, supports the Girls Project and helped expand the project from 7,0 to 40,0 girls. This is part of a new nation-wide effort to keep girls in school that may see the Girls Project expanded across all of West Bengal within the next few years. The international community has also taken up this issue: the United Nations launched the inaugural International Day of the Girl just two years ago and leaders from Hillary Clinton to Archbishop Desmond Tutu are speaking out against the practice of child marriage. Tutu recently proclaimed that by ignoring the problem of child brides, “you dismiss more than half of humanity.” The Girls Project -- and similar projects around the world, tackling challenges once seen as too sensitive or ingrained to change -- should be celebrated, expanded, and replicated to ensure that girls like Khatun have a chance to change their destiny.", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing, “Worldwide Threats,” witnesses: Director of National Intelligence JamesClapper and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, February 26, 2015. CLAPPER: 2014 saw, for the first time, destructive cyberattacks carried out on U.S. soil by nation-state entities, marked first by the Iranian attack against the Las Vegas Sands Casino Corporation a year ago this month and the North Korean attack against Sony in November. Russia and China continue to develop very sophisticated cyber programs. While I can’t go into detail, the Russian cyber threat is more severe than we have previously assessed, and Chinese economic espionage against U.S. companies remains a major threat, despite detailed private-sector reports, scathing public indictments and stern U.S. (inaudible). Moving onto terrorism, in 2013, just over 11,500 terrorist attacks worldwide killed approximately 22,0 people. Preliminary data for the first nine months of 2014 reflects nearly 13,0 attacks, which killed 31,0 people. When the final counting is done, 2014 will have been the most lethal year for global terrorism in the 45 years such data has been compiled. About half of all attacks, as well as fatalities, in 2014 occurred in just three countries: Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Of the 13 attacks in the West since last May, 12 were conducted by individual extremists. Since the conflict began, more than 20,0 Sunni foreign fighters have travelled to Syria from more than 90 countries to fight the Assad regime. Of that number, at least 13,600 have extremist ties. More than 3,400 Western fighters have gone to Syria and Iraq. Hundreds have returned home to Europe. About 180 Americans or so have been involved in various stages of travel to Syria. I should point out, this is those who’ve attempted to go, didn’t get there, those who got there and were killed, those who got there who fought and went to another country and some number have come back. Home-grown violent extremists continue to pose the most likely threat to the homeland. Lone actors or (inaudible) groups who act autonomously will likely gravitate to simpler plots that don’t require advanced skills, outside training or communication with others. … CLAPPER: The intelligence community view is that if we were to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine that this would evoke a negative reaction from Putin and the Russians. It could potentially further remove the very thin fig leaf of their position that they have not been involved in Ukraine and could lead to accelerating or promoting more weaponry and higher sophistication into the separatist areas to support the separatists. … CLAPPER: I’ve said every year, and this will be the fifth year in my 50-plus years in the intelligence business, I don’t know of a time that has been more beset by challenges and crises around the world. … CLAPPER: The current [ISIL] estimate is -- we’re standing on here is somewhere in the range between 20 and 32,0 fighters. Now, the difficulty here is assessing who’s a core fighter who does this whole time, who may be a facilitator or supporter and do it part time, and all that sort of thing. I will say that this is one effect of the air strikes has been substantial attrition. They lost at least 3,0 fighters in Kobani for whatever reason they wanted to do that. And as well, what that’s driving them to now we’re seeing evidence of conscription. …. INHOFE: We have language in our last Defense Authorization bill that we had $75 million where we were encouraging the president to use through the European Reassurance Initiative for weapons going into -- to be of assist to our best friend in that area….I’m talking about sending lethal weapons [to Ukraine]. I can’t figure out why we don’t do it. Let me just ask the two of you. Would you recommend it? CLAPPER: I think, so, from an intelligence community perspective, that is a policy issue. We’re down in the engine room shovelling intelligence coal, and the people up on the bridge, to use a Navy metaphor, drive the ship and rearrange the deck chairs. I have a personal view, and that is only that, that I would favor it. But that’s a personal perspective. INHOFE: I appreciate that very much, and General Stewart. STEWART: We stand by the assessment that lethal aid couldn’t be delivered quickly enough or change the military balance of power on the ground. INHOFE: So, you’re for lethal? STEWART: It would not change the military balance of power, and it couldn’t get there quickly enough to make a difference, and that Russia will up the ante… MCCAIN: Quickly enough? What does that mean? STEWART: Russia and the separatists have significant interior lines that they can resupply a lot faster with a lot heavier weapons than we could deliver -- so it would be a race to see who could arm -- and I think with their interior lines, they would have a significant advantage on the ground. … CLAPPER: [Assad] maintains a control because of his control of the economic leverage to the extent that they have them. His focus is on what I would call the Western spine, say, from Aleppo to Damascus. That’s where most of the population is and the major commercial entities, to include the ports. So he has surrounded by people who are committed to preserving that, because they benefit from it. They are the minority. The Alawites are only 10 percent, so for them, this is an existential struggle. And of course, the irony is that we actually are in common in both Assad and his regime are opposed to fighting ISIL as we are. And so it’s a very, you know, complex array of factors there. …. SHAHEEN: And are you optimistic that Turkey will be more engaged than they have been? CLAPPER: No, I’m not. I think Turkey has other priorities and other interests. They’re more focused on what they consider to be a threat, the KGK, the Kurdish resistance, if you will, in Turkey. Public opinion polls show in Turkey they don’t see ISIL as a primary threat. They’re more focused internally on their economy and this sort of thing. And of course, the consequence of that is a permissive environment because of their laws and the ability of people to travel through Turkey en route to Syria. So somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 percent of those foreign fighters find their way to Syria through Turkey. … CLAPPER: The most troublesome from that standpoint just because of the conditions in Libya. You know, two competing governments fighting with each other. There are in addition, ISIL probably six or eight other terrorist groups that have gathered in Libya. So it’s a magnet because of essentially it’s ungoverned. … (UNKNOWN): What do you asses is Assad’s likely response to the introduction of our U.S. trained Syrians to move in against ISIL in Syria? And do you assess that Assad will attack them? CLAPPER: As long as Assad believes somehow that this -- once it gets up sufficient center of mass, you know, enough force, as long as he felt as though this were -- something to be used only against ISIL, he’d probably be OK with it, but I think he’d have a hard time determining whether it’s a threat to ISIL or a threat to him. So, I could see a circumstance where, depending on what information he’s getting, and we wonder about that sometimes, that he could easily consider that force as a threat to him. (UNKNOWN): Do you believe that you’re receiving good intelligence from Syria, from that are in regards to this? CLAPPER: No, we have a lot intelligence gaps in Syria, principally because we’re not there. So no, I’m not satisfied with that. We’re working at it, obviously, to come up with more intelligence from Syria, but that’s a tough problem for us. (UNKNOWN): Have you received any intelligence that would, I guess, give you comfort in that the moderates that would be trained by us would, in fact, be fighting ISIL and not Assad? CLAPPER: I think a more fulsome response to that would be best in a classified environment, but I guess the short answer would be yes. (UNKNOWN): And how would you assess Russia and Iran will be looking at these trained forces? CLAPPER: Well, probably wouldn’t like it. Russia looks at Syria as a client, as an ally, someone that they provide support to. So, again, it would be almost the same perception problem with the Russians as it would be with Assad. If they could probably rationalize if it’s focused on ISIL, but it’s perceived as a threat to the regime, then I think that they would react negatively to it. (UNKNOWN): And if they would perceive it as a threat, what type of force would they employ then? You said they’d react negatively. CLAPPER: The Russians? Well, this is really speculative, hypothetical. I don’t think they would necessarily deploy combat forces to Syria. They would probably step up military-equipment support, which they’ve been doing, intelligence support if, in fact, they too perceive that what we were doing was a direct threat to Assad. … STEWART: The best propaganda victory that we could give ISIL is to make this a fight between the West and Islam, and ISIL. But being able to provide ISR, precision fires, some commanding control will certainly help those forces, Iraqi forces to be much more effective on the ground than left to their own devices. … MANCHIN: The rapid rise as far as when we first heard about ISIS, it was 3,0, 5,0, then it just seemed to leapfrog -- 10,0, 15,0, 20,0 and 30,0. Were they paying their soldiers or attracting because of better pay than. CLAPPER: The reason there was sort of a mushrooming growth there in the initial phases when they did their attacks in northern Iraq was because this is largely a Sunni region. They were very receptive, frankly, to joining up with ISIL, which, I think, many viewed as a better protector of themselves and their communities and their families then were the Iraqi government. So that’s what occasioned the joining-up. … CLAPPER: Well, I think our function in the intelligence community is to portray as accurately as we can what we see as the threats. We probably always occupy the half of the glass that’s empty, and policymakers and oftentimes military commanders will occupy the half of the glass that’s full. Probably the real truth is at the water line. I think our instinct, frankly, is to perhaps -- I’ve been criticized for this -- worst-case -- the situation, having been on the receiving end of virtually every post-event critique investigating intelligence failures since 9/11, I think we are much more conservative and much more cautious than others might be about the nature of the world out there. But I think we have a certain institutional responsibility which we try to discharge. If others don’t see it that way or others don’t agree, that’s certainly their prerogative. … CLAPPER: I think aspirationally there is a threat that ISIL poses potentially to the homeland and those they might harbor in their area, particularly in Iraq and Syria, who would do us harm. … CLAPPER: I would volunteer that I think because of the effectiveness of the media campaign, or the propaganda campaign that ISIL mounts, that we the U.S., and we the West, we who oppose ISIL, need to be, I think, much more aggressive in mounting the counter- narrative. … REED: We are taking steps to interdict that communication so that they’re not able to put things up and attract recruits and communicate? STEWART: Well, the problem there is their ubiquitous use of the media. And so the challenge is, how do you take down the Internet? Because that’s more and more what they’re doing. In the day when Al Qaida or ISIL put these things out (inaudible) kind of channelized (ph) and we kind of watched it and could do that. They’ve gotten wise to that, and now they make it very difficult because of the universal forms, and the way they get things out so ubiquitously, very hard to control it. Ergo, what we must do, I believe, is counter the messages. Thanassis Cambanis is a fellow at The Century Foundation and a columnist at the Boston Globe. He is the author of a new book, Once Upon a Revolution: An Egyptian Story. 1. What is the most interesting project you are currently working on? Interesting to whom? As an antidote to the mostly dismal political development in the Arab world these days, I have been trying to document some of the cultural responses to the ongoing turmoil in the region. I have been seeking out urban planners, architects, writers, filmmakers, and other people who are maintaining a creative life in the face of what can feel like a dead-end moment, politically speaking. In some cases I am writing profiles of people and their ventures, like a decaying abandoned mansion in Beirut that has been turned into a collective with an urban renewal mission. In other cases, I am exploring broader concern about the life and death of cities. The underlying question driving this effort is an inquiry into the capacity of public intellectuals to create tangible change. 2. What got you started in your career? I always knew I wanted to be a writer. I just wasn’t sure what kind. When I was kid, I spent summers in Greece hearing stories from my grandparents about the war—for them, that meant World War II and the Greek Civil War that followed it and ended in 1949. I hatched a notion that I wanted to be a war correspondent without any real idea of what that meant, and somehow ended up following that calling. By the time I graduated from university and was working as a reporter, there were sadly plenty of wars underway. The utopian optimism that accompanied the fall of the Berlin Wall evaporated in Somalia, Rwanda, and the wars of Yugoslavian succession. 3. What person, book, or article has been most influential to your thinking? It is so hard to pinpoint one single source, but if I have to limit it to just one, I would say it was The Plague by Albert Camus. I first read it as a teenager and I have read it again every five or so years since then. The characters fighting the plague while cut off from the rest of the world in Oran provide an ideal for how to try to keep a sense of purpose, and a moral compass, in trying circumstances. The heroes of the plague are not ideological. They are pragmatists, trying to be useful and to make sense of whatever comes their way, including human venality and the horror of the plague. 4. What kind of advice would you give to young people in your field? Seek out mentors and editors who will invest time and energy in your work. Take seriously your craft and development as a thinker and writer, and keep your grand ambitions in mind as you try to excel at whatever entry level job you find. There is lots of fear and angst today in the field of journalism, and many young journalists complain that it is nearly impossible to make a secure career in the field (come to think of it, many older veteran journalists voice the same complaint). That is a very real concern: smart, hard-working journalists, with talent and a streak of luck, might find elusive success for themselves— interested editors, fascinating stories, engaged readers—and yet also find themselves unable to pay their rent and student loans. The equation, I fear, drives some of the talent away from journalism and into fields that are equally demanding and underpaid but at least allow the possibility of some stability: fields like human rights research and advocacy, humanitarian aid, NGO or government work, UN consulting, and the like. There is an enduring thirst for international reporting, though, and I have seen a lot of talented and persistent journalists make impressive starts against long odds over the last five or ten years, living on a shoestring in places like Cairo or Beirut, and drawing attention with their excellent work. The flip side, of course, is that many freelancers are pushed by the bad economics of the business and the lack of commitment, in some cases, by their publications to take dangerous risks without any real institutional support. I encourage all journalists at all stages of their career to resist this pressure and demand that publications pay a living wage for the journalism they make and provide responsible support to those who work in war zones. 5. What was the last book you finished reading? An Unnecessary Woman by Rabih Alameddine. 6. What is the most overlooked threat to U.S. national interests? None of the major threats the United States faces today amount to major strategic threats to core U.S. national interests; they pose complex problems that must be addressed creatively through sustained, costly engagement. Top among them are the security threats posed by a belligerent Russia and the failing or rigid states in the Middle East. But the biggest danger to U.S. interests these days is posed by the United States’ own overreaction, fueled by its own runaway security state, which dwarfs anything President Eisenhower had in mind when he warned against the military-industrial complex. Today, an enormous portion of the U.S. economy is tied up in surveillance, control, and threat inflation. This vast roiling sea—people performing security theater at airports, agencies collecting data we can’t analyze—makes it all the harder to detect and prioritize actual threats. 7. What do you believe is the most inflated threat to U.S. national interests? Jihadist violence and terrorism. Groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) pose a real and tangible threat, but takfiri jihadist terrorism has been the single most overhyped phenomenon of our age. Murderous nihilists from Osama bin Laden, to Abu Musab al Zarqawi, to Abu Bakr al Baghdadi have swelled to importance far out of proportion to their very real, but strategically limited, ability to wreak mayhem. They are thugs, and in some instances have amassed power that demands a carefully planned, sustained, and powerful response. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not trying to say that they are not important or do not demand a serious U.S. policy and security response. But perhaps, because of the fears they endanger, these jihadists have proved capable of manipulating the United States and provoking reactions that suit their own ends. It is like the U.S. government stops thinking when it comes to takfiri jihadis. A Syrian dictator drops nerve gas on his own people and the United States announces, and then backs away from, a bombing campaign. But then a masked sadist taunts the president and murders an innocent citizen on video, and the United States is immediately ready to begin another war in the Arab world? 8. What is the most significant emerging global challenge? Questions like this alway leave me floundering. Probably the biggest challenge is finding ways to spread sustainable prosperity into the quarters where it has been denied. In quasi-failing states like Egypt, that means the basics: housing, health care, literary, subsistence, jobs. In Europe, it means enabling the chronically unemployed to generate livelihoods and wealth. An unconscionable amount of wealth and waste has been generated over the last generation, and it has been far too inequitably spread around the world and within the wealthy societies at the top. This failure can propel instability anywhere: in an increasingly unequal United States, a struggling, polarized Euro-zone, and across the global south. 9. What would you research given two years and unlimited resources? Identity formation in conflict. I have always been fascinated by the power of individual actors and ideological movements to drive change, for good as well as for ill. Often this power arises from a real or perceived sense of shared grievance that leads to the construction of a tangible community and, often, of a coherent ideology. At root, an ideological commitment and a personal identity serve as the cornerstone of any powerful community, and yet, these ideologies and identities are fluid and malleable. I would like to describe in as great detail as possible the factors that create and shift these identities. I have watched this process up close in Iraq and Lebanon, and I have read about it extensively in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. But there are countless examples from history. 10. Why should we read Once Upon a Revolution if we already know how Egypt’s uprising turned out? It’s not a thriller! But, in a way, it is a mystery; the Tahrir Square revolution really was not supposed to happen, and even its most faithful partisans were shocked by how far they got. I followed a core group of revolutionary activists for four years; they were exceptional because they were the visionaries who, from the start, understood their quest was political and were not afraid to act as leaders even in an uprising that fetishized the idea of having no leaders. “Revolution” sounds grand and sweeping, but like any historical event, it occurred down in the weeds, in the details. Individuals like Basem, the secular nationalist architect, and Moaz, the Muslim Brotherhood pharmacist, began with a mindset that would be familiar to most of us, and then made a series of improbably, often very imaginative and courageous, choices. Multiplied by thousands, that is what sparked the Tahrir Square revolution, and what will continue to cause upheaval in Egypt and the rest of the Arab world until abusive dictatorships are replaced with accountable governments that respect citizens. This book ends with the revolutionaries defeated by a new version of the old regime, but they are still fighting and, more importantly, the same grievances that sparked Tahrir are burning even more intensely today. Dictatorship might well prevail in the end, but we are not there yet. This is a human story, and it helps us understand why the last four years are only the opening chapter in what will be a generational struggle in Egypt. More on: Intelligence Military Operations Department of Defense Press Briefing by Rear Adm. Kirby in the Pentagon Briefing Room, U.S. Department of Defense, February 18, 2015. Rear Adm. Kirby: These are actually proscriptions in place that we will follow and we will expect anybody that receives these systems to follow…It’s in our best interest to be able to have this kind of control, supervision, and scrutiny over the potential delivery of these systems because it’s a ubiquitous, now, capability. Not every nation has the same sophistication at it as we do, but this is a technology that’s not going away. So, it suits our interests, and I think it should suit the American people’s interests to know that we’re going to be involved, from soup to nuts, on how these systems are eventually transferred. (3PA: Kirby’s comments were in reference to a policy released by the State Department this week, which is the topic of my new column on ForeignPolicy.com.) Askold Krushelnycky, “ Ukrainian Forces Recover Downed Russian Drone,” The Intercept, February 17, 2015. A Russian drone was shot down over the weekend during heavy fighting against separatist forces near the government-held port city of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian forces.The drone was quickly identified as a Russian-designed and manufactured drone designated E08 by its manufacturer, the Enics company, whose logo and name appear in Cyrillic on its fuselage… Members of Ukraine’s 37th Mechanized Battalion, who brought down the drone, saw itcrash into the Azov Sea, fringing the conflict zone. (3PA: In a recent Brookings Institution report on policies to preserve Ukrainian independence and prevent Rusian aggression, the authors noted that Ukrainian military officers claimed they have “no capabilities to jam or down Russian UAVs.” Of course, they do; drones are easy to shoot down.) Aisha Ahmad, “ The Security Bazaar, Business Interests and Islamist Power in Civil War Somalia,” International Security, 39(3), Winter 2014/15, pp. 89-117. Since the collapse of its government in 1991, Somalia has suffered more than two decades of civil war along clan lines. For fiffteen years, these fierce tribal divisions were the main fault line of conflict. In 2006, however, a new Islamist movement emerged in the capital city of Mogadishu and quickly ousted the heavily entrenched clan warlords. Within the short span of six months, these newcomers accomplished what more than a dozen internationally sponsored peace processes could not: they centralized political control over the majority of the Somali countryside…(p. 90) The estimation results indicate that the price of security was significant in driving the Somali business community’s support for the Islamists over the warlords, and that both clan and Islamic identity may be overstated…(p. 105) This research suggests, however, that both ethnic and Islamic identity politics may actually be overstated in the existing literature, and that more work needs to focus on the pragmatic cost calculations of the business elite. By modeling civil war as a market for the provision of security, this article offers a practical, economic explanation for why Islamists may prove more competitive than groups defined by narrower identities. I argue that because certain Islamist groups have the ability to sell security to prospective buyers across ethnic or tribal divisions, they are able to charge the business elite lower rates than protection rackets that rely on a more limited ethnic or tribal base. By courting the valuable support of the business class, Islamists are thus able to monopolize the market for providing security. (pp. 114-115) Robert L. Grenier, 88 Days to Kandahar: A CIA Diary (New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2015) pp. 413-414. In the midst of these maneuvers, for years the United States could not induce Pakistan to invade and occupy the militant safehaven in North Waziristan, which provided a base for groups whose primary targets were in Afghanistan. The Pakistanis lived in fear that to do so might drive those groups to join forces with others primarily focused on Pakistan, with potentially disastrous consequences to themselves. They had their own challenges, and were not about to take risks to defend foreigners, who—the Pakistanis reasoned—could take care of themselves. Over time, the efforts of Pakistan’s ISI [intelligence agency] to maintain links and to try to manipulate all these groups in defense of its own interests looked progressively to U.S. observers more and more like active Pakistani collusion with those who were killing Americans. In response, the employment of armed drones in the Pakistani Tribal Areas, which had once largely been limited to pinpoint strikes against foreign militants with operational ties to al-Qa’ida, was expanded, if press accounts and those of organizations dedicated to the subject are to be believed, to include attacks against groups of armed men apparently engaged in cross-border insurgency. Out of frustration with Pakistan’s unwillingness or inability to police its own territory, what once had been primarily a counterterrorism tool became a broad-based counterinsurgency tool. As the number of cross-border attacks increased, so did the number of drone strikes. The fact that such “signature strikes” were aimed at local, as opposed to foreign militants, and had a much greater propensity to generate collateral casualties among non-combatants, had the effect of greatly increasingly public outrage in Pakistan, and encouraging yet more militancy. (3PA: I first pointed this out six years ago, and am glad to see a senior CIA official responsible for overseeing these strikes acknowledge this now.) Arthur Schlesinger, A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House (New York, NY: Houghton Mifflin Harcour, 2002) p. 258. “If someone comes in to tell me this or that about the minimum wage bill,” [President] Kennedy said to me later, “I have no hesitation in overruling them. But you always assume that the military and intelligence people have some secret skill not available to ordinary mortals.” More on: Intelligence Military Operations More on: Terrorism and Counterterrorism Helia Ighani is a research associate in the Center for Preventive Action at the Council on Foreign Relations. Since 2001, major metropolitan cities have increasingly conducted gas and chemical attack simulations in subway systems. Police departments carry out these exercises with odorless, colorless, and non-toxic gases to determine how to evacuate passengers in the event of an actual biological or chemical attack, and identify safeguards that could be implemented to prevent potentially catastrophic consequences. Demands for these simulations are based on real ambitions by terrorist groups to acquire biological and chemical weapons. Most recently, a laptop belonging to a member of ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) was found to contain instructions in Arabic on how to develop biological weapons and weaponize the bubonic plague from infected animals. The nineteen-page document suggested using “small grenades with the virus and throw them in closed areas like metros, soccer stadiums, or entertainment centers.” While these terrorist groups may not yet be capable of carrying out such sophisticated attacks, these types of weapons are definitely on their radar. Al-Qaeda has also attempted to develop chemical weapons, even before the 9/11 attacks, and the United States has regularly made efforts to stunt its progress. This is a valid concern for U.S. policymakers, but also for scientists and researchers working to advance the field of synthetic biology. In synthetic biology, engineers tinker with the DNA of existing biological systems, either by isolating, replicating, or adding pieces of DNA. A new Center for Prevention Action discussion paper by Gigi Kwik Gronvall, “ Mitigating the Risks of Synthetic Biology,” looks at the possible outcomes of advancing synthetic biology research. The origins of synthetic biology date back to the beginning of the 20th century. In 1912, French biologist Stéphane Leduc demonstrated that he wanted to enable man “by directing the physical forces which are its cause” to synthetize lifeforms and enhance the way the world understands science. Nearly a century later, Craig Venter revolutionized the field by sequencing the human genome. The field has rapidly advanced over the last decade. It is a growing industry with labs all over the world. Some estimate that the synthetic biology industry market will jump from $1.6 billion in 2011 to as high as $16 billion by 2018. However, this growth also brings a host of possible risks and benefits. The greatest risk to U.S. national security is bioterrorism and the deliberate misuse of synthetic biology. For example, as foreign fighters with scientific and medical know-how flock to join the ranks of ISIS and other terrorist groups, they could return to their home countries and carry out an attack on the West. The prevalence of do-it-yourself (DIY) bio labs is also increasing, with regard to scientific development and research. One of these amateur bio labs has produced seeds for glow-in-the-dark plants, which were sold to more than eight thousand people via a Kickstarter campaign. But since these labs are unregulated, they could also easily be used to recreate harmful pathogens (such as the Ebola virus or influenza). Moreover, there is no all-comprehensive reporting system for biological accidents that occur in unofficial and official bio labs. On the other hand, the advancement of synthetic biology could produce many humanitarian and ecological benefits. It has been used for the development of an antimalarial drug in endemic regions in Africa. Synthetic biology could open the way to more innovation, including possible cures to world hunger, cancer, and environmental degradation. The United States is currently the lead funder of synthetic biology research and innovation. In 2010, over half a dozen U.S. government agencies had pledged funding for synthetic biology research, spending over $430 million on research since 2005. There are many benefits to the development of synthetic biology, but a lack of regulation or oversight could produce disastrous results. Over sixty staff members were unintentionally exposed to anthrax in June 2014 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where national regulation and oversight are a priority. Read the discussion paper, “ Mitigating the Risks of Synthetic Biology,” to learn more about the potential risks and benefits of synthetic biology, possible ways to prevent or mitigate a catastrophe, and U.S. policy recommendations for domestic and international partners.

{"text": "Paul Joseph Watson &amp; Alex Jones INFOWARS Isn’t it ironic how the mainstream media has the nerve to lecture everyone else about “fake news” when they are the primary source of fake news on a consistent basis stretching back years? Fake news stories and fake narratives put out by the mainstream media have resulted in deaths, destruction and people’s lives being ruined. The most harmful fake news is routinely published by the mainstream media. They are the main progenitors of fake news. – The fake news that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destructionand that Iraq was involved in 9/11, dutifully regurgitated without question by the mainstream media, resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqis, thousands of dead and injured U.S. troops, and the destabilization of an entire continent. – The fake news that the rebels in Syria were “moderates” who did not have jihadist sympathies and should be supported led to the destruction of Syria, Libya and the rise of ISIS. – The fake news narrative that the media was balanced in its coverage of the presidential election was completely obliterated when Wikileaks emails revealed that countless mainstream media reporters were in bed with the Clinton campaign, feeding them debate questions beforehand and conspiring with Hillary’s staff to portray her in a positive light. – The fake news that George Zimmerman was obsessed with Trayvon Martin’s race before the altercation that led to Martin’s death was accomplished by means of NBC deceptively editing an audio tape. This incident stoked racial tensions across the country and laid the groundwork for the violent ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement that was to follow. – The fake news that produced the “hands up, don’t shoot” narrative, which was proven to be completely fraudulent, led to riots, violent attacks and looting in Ferguson, Missouri, as well as numerous other U.S. cities. Even after the rioting began, the mainstream media continued to legitimizethe unrest. Fake news outlets continued to parrot the “hands up, don’t shoot” narrative even after it was proven false. – The fake news that saw innumerable people accused of rape at college campuses across America, claims that were proven wrong, ruined people’s lives and perpetuated the myth (fake news) that one in five women are raped on college campuses. – The fake news that George W. Bush served dishonorably during his time in the Air National Guard was broadcast by CBS News with the aid of fake documents. In circulating this fake news, CBS tried to influence the 2004 presidential election but only ended up crucifying their own credibility, leading to Dan Rather’s resignation six months later. – The fake news that NBC anchor Brian Williams faced enemy fire while helicoptering into Iraq in 2003 was exposed when soldiers who were aboard the helicopter blew the whistle on his lies. Despite admittedly putting out fake news, Williams still has a career in broadcast journalism. – The fake news narrative that Donald Trump somehow represents the next coming of Hitler has provoked a hysterical anti-Trump hate crime wave across America, with people and property being attacked on a routine basis. The same hysterical fake news narrative was also responsible for violence and riots at Trump events throughout the campaign cycle, as well as assassination attempts on Trump’s life. – The fake news that Donald Trump had no chance whatsoever of winning the presidential election was proudly pushed by countless mainstream media outlets, with the Huffington Post even predicting that Hillary Clinton had a 98% chance of winning the presidency. When this fake news narrative was completely demolished on November 8, it swept away trust in political polling and the mainstream media to an even greater degree, prompting the backlash that you now see with the corporate press calling everyone else “fake news” when they are the real fake news. – The New York Times – The Washington Post – CNN – NBC News – MSNBC – CBS News – ABC News – Salon.com – The Huffington Post – Rolling Stone – BBC News – Sky News – Financial Times – Politico – New York Daily News – L.A. Times – USA Today – US News &amp; World Report – CBC – Gawker – Newsweek – Time – Business Insider – Daily Beast – VICE – Yahoo News – Daily Kos – Young Turks – Slate – NPR – PBS – Raw Story – New Yorker – Buzzfeed – MoveOn – Think Progress – Media Matters – Wonkette – Center for American Progress – Little Green Footballs – The Economist Below is a list of fake news reporters who colluded with the Clinton campaign to promote fake news. This list is by no means exhaustive, and there are many reporters within these organizations who do not peddle fake news and have spoken out against the mainstream media’s effort to brand dissenting opinion as “fake news”. For example, Matt Taibbi, has called the Washington Post’s fake news blacklist “disgusting” and “shameful”. Glenn Greenwald, who has worked with several of the organizations on this list in the past, also completely eviscerated the credibility of the “fake news list” being used by the Washington Post. The entire “fake news” narrative being pushed by the mainstream media has nothing whatsoever to do with concerns over people being misled. If that were the case, the mainstream media itself would stop habitually lying to the American people and it’s trustworthiness wouldn’t be in the toilet. The whole “fake news” narrative is clearly part of a dirty tricks campaign to pressure governments, Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other tech giants to censor information that is inconvenient to the establishment, for which the mainstream media serves as a mouthpiece. We are competing with the mainstream media and they’re not happy about dissident voices challenging their monopoly on reality. That’s why they’re forced to resort to underhanded and deceptive means through which to silence their ideological opposition. By circulating this article and this fake news list, we are not calling for these outlets to be censored, we are simply drawing attention to the fact that the very same entities who cry “fake news” are the primary sources for the most damaging, harmful and woefully inaccurate fake news stories in the history of modern journalism.

{"text": "In an earlier post, I wrote about the emergence of Turkey and Brazil on the world stage. Since then, the ‘terrible twins’ voted against the Security Council’s latest set of (almost certainly ineffective) sanctions against Iran. The Obama administration had worked hard to get both countries on board; their rebuff dramatized the limits of President Obama’s clout — but their isolation on the Security Council (the sanctions carried 12-2-1, with only intimidated Lebanon abstaining) dramatically illustrated something else: the impotence of the terrible twins. Brazilian President Lula and Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan spoke out, but nobody listened. Brazil and Turkey are learning something that more experienced world players already know: it is easier to make a splash than to make a change, easier to grab a headline than to set an agenda. Both countries can expect a rocky ride for some time; the democratic forces propelling new parties and new movements to the fore reflect domestic constituencies, domestic ideas and, in some cases, domestic fantasies about how the world works. Developing viable foreign policies that take those interests and values into account, but also respond to the realities and necessities of the international system will take time and take thought. At this point, it seems clear that neither the Brazilian nor the Turkish administrations have mastered the challenge. Their joint intervention on the Iranian nuclear program gives an impression of naive over-eagerness. If the two countries had wanted to play a serious and constructive role (and there was room for them to do so) they would have needed to inform themselves more fully about the state of play, build confidence among the current group of six countries who have been handling the issue (the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany), and take a proposal to Iran that had a realistic chance of being accepted by both sides. The proposal they submitted to the Iranians was sloppy and ill-advised, clearly doomed from the start. Even very casual conversations with Russia and China would have told the Turks and Brazilians that this was a non-starter. In the end, the Turks and Brazilians come out of the incident looking both weak and naive: it appears that they were used by Iran for a last-minute propaganda ploy. As a result, Turkey and Brazil have lost diplomatic prestige and clout, damaged relations with some of their key partners and underlined the limits of their influence. This is not a success and, in Turkey’s case at least, it should serve as a first warning about the many dangers the country will face if it is truly resolved on embracing a more active diplomatic role in the Middle East. Turkey’s dangerous and tumultuous neighborhood, repeatedly torn by war and ethnic conflict, filled with mutually hostile and suspicious states, riven with religious strife and beset with a variety of external shocks from the fall of the Soviet Union to the US invasion of Iraq, is not the kind of place where suckers get an even break. You screw up here, and you pay. Modern Turkish foreign policy has rested on principles laid down by Kemal Ataturk in the 1920s. Turkey’s future, Ataturk believed, lay with the West. To the east and the south, he saw only trouble. There was nothing to be gained by quarrels with the neighbors, and to meddle in their affairs and attempt to build Turkish influence in the old Ottoman domains in Asia and Africa would bring only heartache. This didn’t mean that Turkey should be a western puppet; Ataturk’s successors stayed out of World War Two. While Turkey responded to Soviet pressure by moving closer to the US during the Cold War, Turkey always maintained an independent stance and at times (for example, when it invaded Cyprus in 1974) it defied Washington and the NATO alliance. Unlike the secular Kemalists who want to continue Kemal Ataturk’s foreign and domestic policies, Prime Minister Erdogan and his AK Party seek to dismantle Ataturk’s legacy of fierce, anti-religious secularism at home (and to dismantle the sometimes Orwellian state apparatus that Turkish analysts call the ‘deep state’ which enforced the Kemalist consensus).They also want to set aside his foreign policy ideas and test the possibilities for a more active Turkish role to the south and east: in the Arab world, in Turkic-language speaking and energy rich Central Asia, with Iran and with Pakistan. Religion is part of the pull; the ruling AK Party is backed by religious (though not necessarily or even predominantly fundamentalist) Muslim entrepreneurs and others in the less cosmopolitan heartland of Turkey. An east-facing foreign policy engages Turkey more with those that many pious Turks consider their natural associates. But the pull is also commercial. The energy wealth of the Arab and Central Asian states is a powerful draw, especially for Turkey’s active and competitive construction and infrastructure-building firms. As a Muslim state which has build a sophisticated financial and commercial system, Turks have advantages when it comes to marketing and serving the vast markets in their neighborhood. In this hyper-competitive global economy, you need all the advantages you can get and the rapidly growing companies bringing new wealth to the pious Turkish entrepreneurs rising in Anatolia which helped bring the AK Party into government want help as they seek to expand to the east. Inevitably, this draws Turkey into regional politics. Iran and Syria have politicized, top-down economies. Opening economic doors to Turkish companies can mean building political relations with regimes that have their fingers in every pie. By improving relations with Iran and Syria, the Turkish government is satisfying ideologues nostalgic for an ‘Ottoman’, eastward-looking foreign policy; it builds Turkey’s reputation as an independent emerging power, pleasing Turkish nationalists of all stripes; it highlights the value of its friendship to Europe and the United States by hinting at what a hostile Turkey might look like; it promotes the economic interests of Turkey as a whole and especially of its most important backers and constituencies. Given all these advantages, it’s not surprising that the Turkish government has flirted with an east-facing policy. But continuing down this path may not be as rewarding. The world to Turkey’s east and south is an unstable and unhappy place. Both Arabs and Persians gave the Ottoman sultans one headache after another; an east-facing Turkey today may be headed for more trouble than its government wants. For one thing, the more ‘Middle Eastern’ Turkey looks — the more it is engaged in regional politics — the less likely it is to join the EU. The prospect of joining the European Union is one of the few goals that the new government shares with the old establishment. For the AK Party, joining the EU will force the Turkish military to continue its retreat from politics. Military coups aren’t allowed in the European Union. For the secularists, EU laws on human rights and free expression will limit the ability of the religious lobby to ‘Islamize’ Turkish public life. For Turkey’s large and restive Kurdish minority, EU membership offers the prospect of full legal rights, funds for development in the impoverished eastern provinces where many Kurds live, and in general helps tilt Kurdish opinion away from those who favor armed struggle. For all Turks, EU membership, assuming it can be achieved, would bring enormous economic opportunities as well as the satisfaction that comes from being elected to one of the world’s most prestigious and exclusive clubs. It may be that Turkey’s EU dream is doomed to die. The Europeans, led by France and Germany, are clearly getting cold feet about Turkish accession and are bitterly regretting all those promises they made years ago. But formally the EU is still committed to a process of negotiating with Turkey over Turkish accession, and in the EU system those formal agreements still count. If Turkey gives up on the EU, or if the catastrophically shortsighted Europeans fail to grasp how essential to Europe’s own peace and power Turkish membership is, the effects in Turkey will be profound. The pro- and anti-Kemalist, secular and religious wings of Turkish society will be much closer to conflict and the armed forces will lose some of their inhibitions against military rule. The danger that despair would drive more Kurds toward a violent path cannot be ignored, and given the vast flow of arms and black market money in the region (think of the wars in the Caucasus and Russia’s campaigns against insurgent movements among its own minorities) the potential for serious mayhem cannot be overlooked. That EU dream may die someday — but it cannot be in Turkey’s interest to kill it. The EU remains Turkey’s best bet; carving out the best possible economic and political deal in the short- to medium-term combined with a path to full ultimate membership however winding and long is Turkey’s best choice. A Turkish offer to defer immediate membership in exchange for a firmer ultimate commitment combined with an advantageous deal now would let the current generation of EU politicians off the hook. That deal could be structured to give Turkey a greater political voice in EU decision making as well as some concrete advantages on trade terms and aid for Turkey’s poorer regions. With Greece both weakened and looking to Turkey for help to rebuild its economy, some of the usual voices raised against Turkish goals may be weaker than usual in Europe. The EU is the world’s largest consumer market; Turkey should use the opportunities it now has to cut a deal with the EU that gives it more of the substantial real benefits of membership while holding back on formally joining the club. The US should be working in Europe and Ankara to help facilitate a development that would help all concerned. The move to the east has many more dangers and many fewer advantages. Anti-Kemalist (or post-Kemalist) Turks may see the Islamic world as a warm and welcoming place, but the Middle East in particular is a place of hard politics and bitter enmities. Turkey’s pro-Iranian intervention has alarmed and enraged many of the region’s wealthiest and most powerful Arab states who see Iran as a greater danger even than Israel. The Turkish rapprochement with Syria similarly infuriates Arabs who see Syria as part of a hostile ‘Shi’a Crescent’ stretching from Iran to Lebanon that seeks to undermine both the Arab nation and orthodox Islam. Turks sometimes do not fully grasp just how much the Arab world resented Ottoman imperialism; Ottoman nostalgia may be fashionable among some Turks, but it has few echoes in countries that suffered grievously under what they saw as corrupt and ineffective Ottoman rule. From a Turkish point of view it may be worth noting that assistance to the (mostly) Sunni Kurds is exactly the kind of thing that would appeal to Arab powers horrified by Iranian power and its relationship with a Syria under the rule of a pro-Shi’a religious minority in a nominally secular system. The Kurdish region lies across the northern frontiers of the Shi’a crescent from Iran through Iraq, Syria and of course stretches well into Turkey. The promotion of insurgencies is one of the weapons that the Gulf states know how to wield and it is hard to see how Kurdish unrest could be confined to Syria and Iran. Even the Palestinian issue holds pitfalls. The misguided Israeli response to the Turkish ‘aid flotilla’ understandably inflamed Turkish nationalist opinion, giving the AK Party a powerful boost against its traditionally pro-Israel Kemalist rivals. It also boosted Turkey’s profile and popularity across the region. So far, so good — from the AK point of view. But it is easier to play the Palestinian card than to win the game. Most of the Sunni Arab governments, while continuing to sympathize with the Palestinian cause, are appalled by Hamas’ increasing affiliation with and dependence on Shi’a Iran. The aid flotilla wasn’t just aimed against Israel; it was aimed against the Palestinian government on the West Bank, Egypt (which supports the boycott of Hamas-ruled Gaza and even enforces a blockade of its own) and the Gulf Arab states who are more concerned about Iran than about Israel right now. It would be a grave and foolish mistake for Turkey to underestimate the costs of making the Arab world its opponent. I am not sure that the Turkish prime minister and those around him have fully weighed the risks — or that they understand the degree to which the Iranians perceive them as ‘useful idiots’ to be exploited and betrayed on other issues as they were on the nuclear issue at the Security Council. The Gulf Arab states are not just American allies. They have close ties to Europe as well and their views are listened to in Beijing and Moscow. Iran’s isolation at the Security Council is more than a reflection of American power; it is a reflection of the serious and mounting concern among the other oil producing states about revolutionary Iran. Choosing Iran over the rest of the world is not smart policy for Turkey. Whether the question is economic growth, the Armenian question or settling the Kurdish problem, a deepening relationship with Iran drives wedges between Turkey and the partners it urgently needs. Brazil can probably afford a few ill-considered ventures into Middle Eastern politics; for Turkey the costs are much higher. Ataturk’s western orientation was partly about cementing Turkey’s place in the richer and more technologically advanced west; it was also about sealing Turkey off from the divisive conflicts in the east. Frustration with the west is understandably leading some Turks to look east; the results are more likely to vindicate Ataturk’s view of Turkish national strategy than to refute it.", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Twitter and Reddit user @MetricMapshas developed a GIF that shows the steady rise of America's state and federal prison population from 1978 to 2012. The map shows that the South - and Nevada - were leaders in increasing incarceration, but that most of the rest of the country has followed. via @MetricMaps Incarceration rates are mostly due to government policies, not to crime rates - that's true at the national level, and it's true for differences between states as well. Andbecause most of the US prison population is housed in state prisons, state laws, in particular, are the biggest factor in the rise of mass incarceration - and differences between similar states can be explained by differences in their laws. As legal historian Sara Mayeux wrote in 2010: Incarceration rates are largely driven by policy choices, not crime rates or demographics. Wisconsin and Minnesota have similar demographics and crime rates but Wisconsin has a much larger prison population. A similar disparity exists between North Dakota and South Dakota. However, demographics are certainly an important part of the story, given that African American and Hispanic men are incarcerated at such a higher rate than other groups. The fact that the trend toward mass incarceration started in the Deep South is evidence for Michelle Alexander's thesis that mass incarceration is \"the new Jim Crow\": a set of policies that work together to control the black population. Even states with low overall incarceration rates can still be guilty of racial disparities in enforcement. In fact, the states with the biggest racial disparities in marijuana arrests between blacks and whites are all in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, not in the South. CORRECTION: This article originally displayed a map that showed the incarceration rates of female prisoners. We apologize for the error.", "label": "true"}

{"text": "80 Shares Hebron Closed Down Last week, the Israeli Defense forces closed off Hebron’s Tel Rumeida neighborhood entirely, designating it a “closed military zone.” This development is just the latest in an ever growing war of attrition being waged in Palestinian territory. Hebron, or al-Kahlil in Arabic, is the largest city in the West Bank and has become ground zero for Palestinian resistance against the occupation, especially in the last month. The city is home to 170,0 Palestinians and roughly 600 Israeli settlers, divided since 1997 between the H1 and H2 sectors. This designation was established by the Hebron Protocol, an agreement signed by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat. The accord arranged implementation of the Oslo II Interim Agreement, including Israeli troop withdrawal from 80 percent of Hebron. But the Palestinian communities remained wary of any Israeli troop presence in the city and the settlers felt cheated by the Israeli government. These arrangements additionally put H1 under Palestinian Authority control and H2 under Israeli military rule. But in reality, both sectors are highly militarized by the IDF, and the distinction has become banal. And so the ancient city--home to the Cave of Machpelah, Hebrew for patriarchs, and al-Haram al-Ibrahimi, Arabic for Ibrahimi Mosque--continues sitting on the precipice of a modern war. Hebron is no longer a powder keg--it is a minefield. The city is unique in that a small group of extremely ideological Jewish settlers literally live within Palestinian neighborhoods. The story says that Moshe Levinger, a prominent voice in the Israeli settler movement, rented a hotel room in Hebron for Passover in the spring of 1968, and just never left. This incident marks the founding of Kiryat Arba, the second Jewish-only settlement established in the West Bank. Today there are 124 official settlements in the occupied West Bank, in which approximately 350,0 residents live, according to B’Tselem. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered illegal by the international community, as the law plainly prohibits an occupying power both from making changes to the occupied territory and from transferring its own citizens there. Kiryat Arba today is home to arguably the most racist settlers, known for frequent and often violent harassment of Hebron’s Palestinian residents. As recently as 30 October, a Hebron shop owner named Ghassan was surrounded by 6 Israeli settlers armed with machine guns, then subjected to death threats by an Israeli woman, according to members of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM) who documented the abuses. Silencing Dissent But as atrocious as the lone incidents of violence are, recent escalations by the IDF are far more worrisome. It seems as if soldiers are being granted more autonomy in preventing activists and journalists from documenting human rights abuses. Since declaring Tel Rumeida a “closed military zone,” the apartment of ISM activists was raided by IDF soldiers and the volunteers evicted. ISM activist Jenny told AH Tribune, “basically the soldiers took the passports and our landlord hostage, saying that if all of us do not leave, they will not let the owner of the house go and everyone will be arrested and deported.” The mission of ISM is to aid the Palestinian communities living under occupation and document abuses, a fact that the IDF know all too well. The activists are frequently prevented from passing through checkpoints or even entering the country, and their status as internationals both affords them more rights than the Palestinians they wish to help and greater risk of deportation. While the eviction took place, two ISM activists, an American and German, were arrested on allegations of “disturbing a soldier” and being inside a “closed military zone.” They were monitoring Checkpoint 56 or Bab a-Zawiya at the time, part of their daily routine of documenting abuses against Palestinians. The activists were released approximately 8 hours later although the soldiers never told them their charges and they were prevented from contacting their respective embassies. Other international activist groups like Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT) and the Ecumenical Accompaniment Program in Palestine and Israel (EAPPI) have been heavily restricted as well. One of the members of CPT was allegedly arrested for posting an Instagram photo and subsequently banned from Hebron for two weeks. And according to Jenny, EAPPI was coerced into leaving the city after Israeli settlers put up posters with pictures of international activists, calling them “hostile anarchists” and “anti-semites.” “It seems like they're trying to get rid of anyone that witnesses and reports on what's happening,” Jenny added, referring to the soldiers. Numerous activist groups operate to keep safe the Palestinian citizens of Hebron. While it should be the law that protects Palestinians just as it does Jews, and the right of all Palestinians to self-determination, Israel denies them these rights for the most part. International Institutions Must Make Israel Accountable And if Hebron is any indication of a paradigm shift in the way Israel treats international activists, the situation for Palestinians has the potential to become far worse. It is unfortunate, but without international witnesses, the world’s atrocities often go unnoticed. Speaking with AH Tribune in October, Issa Amro, a member of the Hebron-based, non-partisan Palestinian activist group Youth Against Settlements said “The Palestinian civilians, they feel not protected, and they want to defend themselves from the soldiers and the settlers.” But Amro expressed the need for international attention, feeling that the struggle has fallen onto deaf ears. “The time that the international institutions start making Israel accountable,” Issa stated, “that is the time when Israeli extremists will stop and the ministry of Israel will be moderate people and not fanatic extreme people.”", "label": "true"}
{"text": "As the world gets hotter, migratory animals move north Reports are piling up of odd animal sightings in northern regions: salmon swimming through the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia; birds like the Cape May warbler moving from U.S. spruce forests to cooler Canadian climes; a fish usually found off the coasts of Africa or southern Europe swimming in a Norwegian fjord; Texas political hatchet men passing pork-filled legislation in Washington, D.C. Scientists are increasingly worried about the impacts such species shifts may have on delicately balanced ecosystems. Those wandering warblers eat a lot of spruce budworm caterpillars, for example, and warbler-free forests will be more vulnerable to wood-drying infestation and subsequent fires. Though many observers link the migrations to global warming, not everyone is convinced. “If you want to measure temperatures, you use a thermometer, not a bird,” said noted climate-change skeptic Fred Singer. “Birds have all sorts of reasons for moving north, south, sideways, or whatever.” Ah, those whimsical birds.", "label": "false"}

{"text": "This is supposed to be a post about how Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon are riding in on white horses to defend the honor of the raving dumpster fire in the White House, which has recently had its feelings hurt and its brain function called into question by Bob Corker, the GOP senator from Tennessee and the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But why should we write about that when President Doy Doy Doy Doy Doy! is perfectly capable of defending himself? YOU SEE WHAT HE DID THERE? (Besides how he’s baby-tweeting about Corker and hasn’t said word fucking one about how there are Americans dying in the California wildfires?) You might be thinking Trump woke up on the illiterate side of the bed this morning (much like the other mornings) but NO, YOU’RE WRONG! Trump did a clever made-up spelling of “little” and he put an apostrophe at the end for no reason! How creative! Bob Corker will surely think twice next time he thinks about exchanging zingers with the master! Anyway, since we mentioned them, Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon are out there being mewling, authoritarian fuckheads about Corker’s comments, which included a tweet about how the White House is obviously an adult daycare with one client named Trump, followed up by a New York Times interview where he called Trump a liar, said every day in the White House is an exercise in making sure the baby is fed and has his rattle so he doesn’t accidentally nuke the moon, and that he’s worried Trump isactuallygoing to fumblefuck us into World War I. (As to Trump’s suggestion that Corker “was made to sound a fool” because he didn’t know the interview was being recorded, LOLOLOLOLOL OK Trump, whatever you think your 80 IQ followers need to hear.) Here’s Conway on “Fox &amp; Friends,” authoritarian-splaining the things,via the Washington Post: Host Brian Kilmeade teed it up nicely, saying, “What a demeaning tweet at the president.” “Well it is, and world leaders see that,” Conway responded. “We’ve all worked with Senator Corker over the years. We thank him for his service, but I find tweets like this to be incredibly irresponsible.” She added: “It adds to the insulting that the mainstream media and the president’s detractors — almost a year after this election, they still can’t accept the election results. It adds to their ability and their cover to speak about a president of the United States, the president of the United States, in ways that no president should be talked about.” Oh for heaven’s sake, Conway, get a grip. People talk about him in ways no president has ever been talked about because he BEHAVES like no other president has ever behaved, by which we mean he takes a golden diarrhea shit on the sanctity of the office of the president of the United States each and every day he continues to occupy it. In other words, he started it. In other words, America is a counterpuncher, and when Trump punches America, America punches back. In other words, fuck you. Conway, of course, thinks the media should be required to say nice things about Trump, and that when the media reports unkind things about him, that it’s “unpatriotic.” Kellyanne Conway doesn’t “America” very good, does she? Now, Kellyanne Conway is a dick, but Steve Bannon, that guy who got fired from the White House and thinks he got a promotion because he’s a blogger now, is having a CONNIPTION. He was firing gin from all his pores when he went on the “Sean Hannity Trump Buttplug Hour,” where they may or may not play with Trump-shaped buttplugs (dunno, we don’t watch that shit), DEMANDING that Bob Corker RESIGN RIGHT NOW for the crime of NOT BEING NICE TO TRUMP, because Steve Bannon is a leaking anal fissure who doesn’t know or care that the Senate is part of a separate, coequal branch of government. You need to watch Bannon’s face when he says all this, because it’s funny when that little pussy is angry: “If Bob Corker had any honor ordecency, he should resignimmediately,” Bannon told host Sean Hannity on Fox News’ “Hannity” on Monday night. […] Corker, Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell(R-Ky.) and the rest of the “globalist clique on Capitol Hill has to go,” Bannon told Hannity. Oh go suck a bag of dicks, Bannon, and when you’re done with that, you’re probably invited to suck Bob Corker’s dick too, assuming the polite senator would deign to let some dirty, gin-soaked blogger affix his chapped lips to his Down Theres. (Doubtful.) Bannon also says he’s going to help primary EVERY REPUBLICAN SENATOR, except for Ted Cruz for some reason (Rebekah Mercer still has feelings for him). Maybe he’s worried Ted Cruz’s dad will assassinate him or something if he does, haw haw, that joke will never not be funny. So who wins the contest for doing sick burns to Bob Corker?

{"text": "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell took home $44 million for his efforts in behalf of his league and his wildly popular sport last year. (That’s right — $44 million — American money.) Quite a haul for anyone, let alone for a guy who has demonstrated over the years, on issue after issue, that he can’t get ahead of his own butt. But this week we’re getting the first hints that the operatically compensated Roger may actually be able to count. In a letter to the NFL’s 32 owners, Goodell suggests that NFL players stand for the playing of the national anthem before games. “Like many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the national anthem,” Roger writes. “It is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.” We certainly do, Roger, and how nimble of you to figure this out in a mere year and a half after 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first took a knee during the anthem to protest what he called a racist America that oppresses black people. Other black NFL players joined in on the gag, and, by and by pre-game NFL games began to resemble a Black Lives Matter rally. Goodell spent most of this time, when not cashing his gaudy paychecks, praising players who were giving the NFL’s paying customers the middle finger and letting players know they were free to ham it up, on the NFL clock, as much as they want to at the expense of those who make the NFL a $14 billion a year industry. Roger’s letter is welcome, even if belated, and even if it should have been couched as a directive rather than an “everyone should” suggestion. And if I were editing the letter I would have changed “many of our fans” to “most of our fans.” But hey, it’s a start. Perhaps league officials have enough sense of self-preservation to keep rolling the ball Jerry Jones set in motion this week by announcing than any of his players who disrespect the flag or the anthem will be benched. Roger’s change of heart, if that’s what this is (and if he has one), was almost certainly a result of accounting rather than principle. The NFL, and other sports leagues, have shown over and over that they don’t give a toss about the sensitivities of their largely traditional and patriotic fans. But so many NFL fans, last year and this, have voted with their feet and their television remotes, that even Roger has noticed. It seems to be dawning on him, and on some owners, that insulting the customer-base in not a good business model. NFL fans are patient. But there’s only so much in-your-face disrespect they will take before they flake out, which they are doing in large numbers. The NFL’s TV rating were down last year and again this year. Ticket sales are off. More football fans than just Vice President Pence are heading for the NFL exits. This still has to play out, and we don’t know where it’s going. Will the NFL move from suggesting players stand and be respectful during the anthem to demanding that they do so? And if they do this, what happens when some players defy the league’s demand, as is almost certain to happen if the league actually grows a spine? Some players have already said they will keep protesting, though the heavens fall. The second part of Goodell’s letter gives us less reason to be encouraged than the first. After stating the obvious that NFL players should be respectful of their country and their patrons, Goodell goes on to say: “We also care deeply about our players and respect their opinions about critical social issues. The controversy over the anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues. We need to move past this controversy and we want to do that together with our players.” This has a weak, wheedling, and watery tone to it. Can’t we all just get along, as someone once asked? And we know what weakness invites. Besides, this is not about having an honest conversation about race in America. America hasn’t had an honest conversation about race in a half century. It’s not likely to ever have one. And an honest conversation is not what the protesters want. They want to nag and lecture, which Goodell and team owners need to tell their players they have every right to do, but on their own time. I’m not overly optimistic that this toxic mess will resolve itself any time soon. I’m encouraged by the new direction taken by Jones and Goodell, but I’d like to see a little more strength and clarity in their message. How about: “Any player who is not on his feet when the national anthem strikes up will be escorted off the premises by security before we get to ‘… and the home of the brave.’” Now that’s a policy stout-hearted American football fans of all races can get behind. This would go miles toward making pro football the unifying force it once was.", "label": "true"}
{"text": "Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a stalwart warrior against the illegal immigrant invasion, has endorsed Donald Trump, and Peter Brimelow has recommended Kobach for the V-P slot. That would be a great choice, rounding out the ticket geographically and adding a first-rate polemicist. I highly recommend this little segment of the PBS newshour, in which Gwen Ifill (fairly, to her credit) interviews Kris Kobach and pro-Rubio Establishment figure Henry Barbour of the Republican National Committee . If you have time (it’s under nine minutes) watch the interview, if you don’t, read the transcript. The interview was conducted after Super Tuesday and before the latest caucuses and primaries but it’s still quite valid. The anti-Trumpsters are holding up Marco Rubio as some great conservative. But in this interview, Kris Kobach coolly and concisely makes the case for Donald Trump and the case against Marco Rubio, pointing out Rubio’s support for amnesty and how he told the Florida voters one thing and did another. Barbour repeats the tired old line that the majority of Republicans are not voting for Trump (in the primaries and polls). But that’s a bogus argument as it could also apply to all the candidates, none of whom has a majority, though Trump is closer than any of them. Barbour actually brings up the bogus K smear against Trump not once but twice, and Kobach calls him on it, pointing out the curious fact that Republicans who use it are adopting the tactics of the Left to attack fellow Republicans. Kobach makes the case for the Trump candidacy by using both the economic and national security arguments relating to immigration, and points out the Republican Establishment’s rejection of blue collar workers. All in all, a great interview. Kobach makes such good arguments in such a brief space of time. In a GOP party that was living up to its professed principles, people like Kobach, and not Barbour, would be running things. Here is the interview Trump’s Super Tuesday victories don’t mean GOP consensus (PBS News Hour, March 2, 2016).", "label": "true"}
{"text": "The University of Texas at Austin needs to consider race in admissions if it wants a diverse, representative student body, the school toldthe U.S. Supreme Court 0n Monday ina 70-page brief filed in advance of oral arguments in the case Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin. The nation's high court will hear arguments in the case, which could bring an end to affirmative action at UT-Austin, this December. The school was sued in 2008 by Abigail Fisher, who argued she was denied admission to UT-Austin because she is white. Her case has already reached the Supreme Court once. In that iteration, the court upheld the use of affirmative action nationwide but asked a lower court to scrutinize UT-Austin's policy. The lower court upheld the school's use of race in admissions, and the Supreme Court now is reviewing that ruling. In Monday’s brief, UT-Austin cites its troubled racial history, noting that a black student wasn’t admitted to the school until 1950. The school also stresses that race is still an issue on campus today. This year, the school noted, UT-Austin became embroiled in a debate about the future of an on-campus statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The statue was eventually removed from its prominent location and will be housed in a U.S. history center instead. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. “UT’s student body brought many different viewpoints to that debate, and this event is just one of many constant reminders that race remains relevant in Austin, as in America, today,” the brief says. That’s just one case in which diversity was valuable on campus, the school said. “The educational benefits of diversity include, but are not limited to, bringing unique and direct perspectives to the issues and topics discussed and debated in classrooms, promoting cross-racial understanding, breaking down racial and ethnic stereotypes, and creating an environment in which students do not feel like spokespersons for their race,” the brief says. The last time the Supreme Court heard the case, it ruled that schools may use affirmative action, but only if they can show that race-neutral policies don’t do the job of diversifying their student bodies. UT-Austin’s opponents have argued that the school does have a sufficient race-neutral policy: the top 10 percent rule. Created in 1997, soon after affirmative action was temporarily banned in the state, the rule required state schools to admit students who graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school class, regardless of test scores or other factors. That helped increase racial diversity because Texas high schools are still largely segregated. But UT-Austin argued that relying solely on that rule “excludes consideration of the broad array of factors that contribute to a genuinely diverse student body.” The school wants people with varied skills and backgrounds, not simply people of different races, the brief said. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. Fisher’s lawyers have disputed that argument, saying the top 10 percent rule has been successful. Her lawyers also suggested that UT-Austin simply wants to be able to admit more rich minorities, rather than minorities from schools in economically disadvantaged areas. UT-Austin disagrees. “She has a dim view of success — and diversity,” the brief says. Right now, UT-Austin caps the number of students automatically admitted at 75 percent of each freshman class. Next year, that means that students who finished in the top 7 percent of their classes will be automatically admitted. The rest of UT-Austin students will be admitted under what the school calls its “holistic review process,” which considers extracurricular activities, non-academic accomplishments, race and more. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case sometime next year. Disclosure: The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.
